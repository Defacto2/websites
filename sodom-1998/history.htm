   Sodom has been started at 11 June of 1995, by one Russian guy, who
 decide prove him self, that he can do the same, i.e start a successfull
 group, and get it on the top. He used to known as KNike from 92 to
 94. In the begining of 1995, he change he's nick to Tok. Word "Tok" in
 Russian language means "Power, High Voltage". He used to be one of the
 Karate Do style "Shatokan" man in Russia. 2 years late he add "Saint" 
 to his nick, because of a lot of reasons. 
 
 
 Tok start looking around, for dedicated guys who can help Sodom. 
 Netrunner came up with name 'Sodom' and it stayed for good, as Label Name. 
 3d person who join Sodom was Jack in The Box (used to have GhostRider 
 and Mr Reflex nicks). Jack bring a lot of fun in the group.
 
 All Sodomers was one of the most popular pirates in Russia, and there was 
 no problem with advertising, everyone knew that new powerfull group on the 
 way, and quite soon everyone will see something quality from those guys. 
 Some time late when 187 (Rebelion Authority, Sodom Whq bbs, Sweden) join 
 Sodom, and other respected guys like:
 Emigree (Splatter King, Sodom Ehq bbs), 
 Explozive (#1 Russian Courier), 
 Captain Power (#1 Saint Petersburg Coder/Cracker) 
 no one even doubt that Sodom will rock this place. 
 
 Sodom was new, and they release everything they found funny, Cracks, 
 Addons, Utils, and even some Games. But in the end of 1995 Sodom turned
 into Utils and Utils Cracks only.

                                SODOM's MANIfESTO

    If you still havent heard about SOdOM.. you're damn lagged, man! =)
    And to keep ya informed, here are some tiny things and facts about
    us. The group was originally formed by T0k (Da Prezident) at Summer-95,
    mainly as a traders group over Internet.
    High council members are living in St.Petersburg [Russia], some guys
    are from Moscow [Russia] and the rest are foreigners - US, Sweden,
    Germany, Australia, whatever.. =)

    By a couple of months, since group started to grow up, we developed
    our goals into some more accurate policy.
    First of all, we are NOT solely couriering group anymore. We believe
    there are enough courier groups on scene already who can do brilliant
    job. The speed of distributing releases over Inet/BBSes is almost at
    the edge of todays technology.. So we see no obvious reasons to float
    on the full-loaded ship.

Instead of rushing for bytes or seconds, we are goin to..

    - Release Russian software as DOD used to do before moving West.
    - Spread this with our own traders division onto affiliate boards
      and sites for further distribution.
    - Produce some quality intros and cracktros as long as we believe
      scene is not 100% warez case, there are alot of other funny things to do.
    - Produce our own electronic mag. The perfect example of great scene
      mag is "PAIN" by Chicken and ULi from Switzerland (used to exist
      in 1994-95).
    - and keep our group as friendly as possible towards others..

The most important thing is that we have some members from Amiga
and C64 scene (I'm from C64 myself). And as far as these guys know
computer underground better than any PC-only freak (their can compare
how things are running on different platforms), we are goin to take
all the best from their experience!

Some slots for entering SOdOM are still vacant. But to become real
part of our family, please read the following and think about it.
These rules are simple:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - WE ACCEPT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SENSE OF HUMOUR.
      We DONT accept attackers, stupidos, ignorant ppl and ego-addicts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - THE BEST AGE IS BETWEEN 18 AND 24 YEARS, by this age the person is
      generally formed (mental and moral) and talk less bullshit.
      Kids are NOT welcome, no matter how fast is your IP-link. =)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - WE WOULD LIKE TO MEET PEOPLE WHO KNOW SCENE' FLAVA AND TRADITIONS.
      Most of our members taking a part in scenelife for 5 years or more.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - GREAT IF YOU LIKE SNAIL-MAIL.
      Swapping old-style letters by mail is fun.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thats almost it..

 It was a time, when Leadership, was busy with advertising on the Internet,
 ran shitloads of projects, to get Sodom a little bit known. Brawley was 
 a person, who made Logo and Diz for Sodom. Leadership did not knew, that 
 it was a diz, which they will use for good. Logo was not too much cute
 to use.

 okey, let us remind you a little from Tok history.... 
 Tok used to has "T0k" nick on Irc, since there was some one else with Tok
 nick, and he decide do not waste he's time to go with _TOK ot shit like 
 that. 
 
 Back to Sodom History... 

 At this time competition was hard, Pwa, Dod, Corp, was most popular
 and respected groups because of they quality and  ultra good releases.
 
 Since Sodom was 70% of Russian guys, and 30% of guys from Russia, Sodom
 has released a lot of quality russian titles which was in english 
 language, like: Stylus lingvo Office. 

 In the begining there was no traffic of releases, and it's hard to remember
 how big was average of releases and mb's of releases per month. Tok
 and Netrunner spend ton's of time per day to bring Sodom to the top
 and they allways trying to be not involved to the fightings or crap wars. 
 You have to know a lot of things, and to undestand what people trying
 to say to you, if you want to keep your self outside of wars, and figths.
 Sodom was too young to deal with Risc/ RTS/ or even Malice (which was 
 the top couriering groups at this time. '95 and early 1996). So next 
 step was cooperation with "motiv8".

 Motiv8 was the 1st and the last official courier group for Sodom. 
 In the end of 1995 Tok (Sodom), Igor and Mason (Motiv8) decided to stick 
 up together. Motiv8 helped Sodom a lot those times. Nihil used to be 
 Motiv8 WHQ, and it was times when couriers support sites under "group"
 login. Sodom got Nihil as they 1st WHQ on the NET. Davan was probably 
 only one on the scene who got all pre-releases from Sodom. Funky thing
 is, that Lester steal Davan to DOD, 6 months later, and after that in 
 some time Davan quit the scene for good. Davan was 1st and #1 Sodom 
 courier on the world sites back in 1995'96. It's a pitty that he is not 
 in the group now a days. 
 
 But Mason (Motiv8 founder) was rarely on irc, Igor (Motiv8 Council) got 
 in a big big vacation, and some shitheads dont even remember he's nick
 decided to kick off Sodom from Official Couriers. 1 Week late, Igor 
 ask Sodom to come back, and deal with Motiv8 again, but it was too late. 
 Sodom was 'independent'. And it was one of the most important things 
 for the group. 

 Since Tok and Netrunner used to be students, and at Spring time of 
 1996 they was overloaded with work and university in the same time, 
 Sodom was sorta slow those times. After a little downhill, Tok came 
 back and bring it back on 8 or 7 place in the world chart of all utils 
 groups. From this time Katz was promoted to Senior position, and Sensi 
 joined as Long Distance courier. 

 You can ask why i said about Katz and Sensi? Because one year late they 
 both will be close to be Sodom leaders, but let's continue with middle 
 of 1996 periud. 
 
 At this time, Sodom known as powerfull, and most important thing that it is
 friendly group, w/o enemies, and fights. Sodom sites was wonderful:
 Progressive - Sodom whq - Was top3 site during the Summer of 1996, 
 Ramirez (Devotion) was the person who bring this site to the top because 
 of he's kickass xftpd code knowledge. Siteops was Tok and Ramirez. It 
 was like a Dream Team in NBA. In 1 month, they bring this site on 
 the top! The only one shame thing was... box owner 'problems'. Site 
 owner decided to close site because of real life reasons. 

 During the 1996 Summer time, major groups was in big big troubles. 
 Dod has a lot of weeks w/o releases, because other groups stole a lot of
 Dod suppliers, and Jimmy James was on vacation. Pwa w/o Orion was in the 
 same atmosphere. So competition was not so hard. To be honest.. it was
 the begining of 'www warez' and 'cracked shareware', which is not realy
 fun. 
 
 At this time, Infernal Flames <Sodom/Acid/Fog> created new killer logo
 for <a href="sdmhead.txt">Sodom.nfo</a>.  

 For that time Sodom alredy was known as group which dominate on the scene 
 with NOVELL releases. For 1996 Sodom has been released 0.9 Gb's of 
 Novell Software, which is 95% of all Valid Novell products for 1996, other 
 5% was - Dod - and other groups. Valid Novell products means, no 
 documentantions, no plain tutorials, no advertising crap, and so on. 
  
 In the end of Jule'96, Tok and Jack in The box, visited Rebels leadership. 
 It was fun, and sure there was ton's of beer, and vodka. Personal greets 
 from this party going to: Omnibuz, Eddie, GodFather, Emigree, Serial Killer.
 It's fun to remember how drunked Omnibuz offered to merge Sodom and 
 Rebels together. The only one problem was that Omnibuz wanted it
 merge under Rebels name, and Tok/Jaq was for SODOM FLAG!  

 We cant forget that Sodom start they own Emag - Defacto, 1 month late
 Defacto became independent. It was 'RCN' times, times, when people
 readed RCN, and created they own visions of scene on RCN articles, and
 interviews. Let's say, that it was one of the realy bad times for warez
 scene. Would you like, if some one, who dont fucking know shit about 
 your business will start describe, and BLAIM you? Would you like, if you
 will read bullshi about your self? If there no chance to change the 
 situation? Well, too much mistakes was from RCN side. I wish nothing
 like this will shoup on the scene in the future. 
 
 September, October, And November months was worse months in the 
 Sodom history. In the end of November Sodom leader ask him self about 
 Sodom future, and there was question: "Do i need continue Sodom or not?", 
 In this time, guys like: Ipggi, Ramirez, and Katz, quited group because 
 they was not happy with group and internal feeling. Tok was overloaded with 
 Real life. But after leaving of such important guys, he came back, and 
 start working on global reconstruction inside the group.  

 About 1 week late, Katz came back and was promoted to Vice President 
 position. This women made so much good things for Sodom, she build
 awesome internal friends feeling in the group, and always trying to 
 help everyone who looking for a help, or a person who can listen to you
 and give you some solution. 

 We all is happy that Sodom still alive and they did not kill it, in 
 the end of 1996 november. In the end of December Sodom was on 7 or 6 
 place in the world, of Utils groups. 

 
 In the end of 1996, Tok found that 1996 year was not so bad for Sodom, 
 a lot of world top titles was out from Sodom this year: Borland Delphi 
 2.1, Borland TASM 5.0, Microsoft Money 95 5.0, Mathematika 3.0, and 
 Novell as well. List of Sodom releases for 1996 is unreal big, 
 there was around 250-270 releases for 1996. And about 2-3% got nuked 
 on bbs/sites, with "Dupe" or "Free" reason, i think that's ok, Every 
 group had NUKED RELEASES. And 2% is not so many for 250 releases. 
 Sodom is not scared, to show and to tell that they got nuked somewhere
 some times, it's not the big deal. There no 'no-nuke' groups around who 
 is alive for more than 1 year. And every group have rights for fuckups. 
 The other thing is, how often they are in fuckups. 


 In 1996 there was ton's of "Live" Sodom parties in Real life, with 
 Russian Sodomers almost. Sodom is entered in 1997 as well known and 
 respected group, the group with own attitude which was one of the  
 best in my mind. 

 1996.... some people quited, some people joined. It was 1st 'full yaer'
 for the group. Group did not became disbanded, merged in to the other
 group, and did not ruined own reputation. Group became better
 than it was in the begining of 1996, so there was progress and group
 growed up. That is what is all about. Keep your group growing up, 
 keep it breathing, and make it better and better is the things which 
 hard to control. 
 
 Sodom was always more Euro group than Usa. In the begining of 1997, 
 group has 2 leaders: Saint Tok, and Katz. 
 We cant forget such guys as:
 - Halfback, who was known as one of the best Couriers, 
 - Heron who started as supplier, and became in charge of internet sites part 
 of Sodom,
 - Felony the leader of Sweden local group, and the man who loved sodom 
 so much,
 - Noface, best Euro utils cracker, and supplier,
 - Sensi vice president and the man who know what FUN is for,
 - Axhate courier who can solve any problems he want, 
 - Cyclops is an ultra pakager and one of the most friendly sodomers,
 - Koop[Censored] 100% dedicated [Censored] Supplier, and all other
 Sodomers who keeped they life with Sodom more than 2 years. 

 All February 1997 was slow for All the groups on the scene, since 
 Cyber Strike, but from middle of March, Sodom start shooting again. 
 890mb's of releases for 3 weeks, inlcude: Novell, Adobe, Corel, and Watcom.

 After 14 April of 1997 Saint Tok decide get a long break from the scene, 
 and get some relaxation in real life with he's own business and studying. 

 In the end of May, Saint Tok came back in to the business, from vacation.
 Sodom closed they doors on the irc (+i), and hide for good, from all 
 lamers, and cops who where trying to get in touch with Sodomers. It was 
 a times, when group thought about creating security department against
 kids/cops/maniacs on the net. Peace is what this group was always about. 
 
 Summer time.. vacations... and real life. Funny time. 
 
 Jule - 1997. New face in the group, who will be able to back up 
 Saint Tok. bK - no one know what for stands bK, but this is nick name 
 of a person who will bring some 'crazy' spirit in the group with 
 progressive and quality suppliers, and releases. Who did not close
 they eyes during the summer, where able to see him working on the 
 internet. bK got under control webpage, releaseas department, 
 crackers department, and recruiting. As result in the August Sodom got
 released 50 Releases. (Visit our Releases 1997 list).

 Sodom changed WHQ. At this time, Whq was one of the ex-Sodom sites, but
 with new hardware, attitude, and vision of scene. In short time, 
 Whq staff said them self, that this is a group where you can stay for 
 good.  

 What is going on with "old" groups in 1997? Pwa... some one call it
 return of the ex-best utils group. But after August (70-80 titles, 
 where 30-50 where the same product, which was milked) PWA stoped. 
 X-force, like always. Dod... the same situation with 1996, and 
 big big downhill. New Star on the Utils scene is: Siege. But who 
 knows how long this star will be in the sky. 

 Home Page of Sodom (www.thesodom.com) moved to (www.sodom.org),
 but it doesnt mean that www.thesodom.com is dead. Group handle 2 
 web sites, that's it. New web design where puted by: Saint Tok, 
 bK, Dj Saru, Deranged. And as people said, it was 'cute' one. ;) 

 Sodom start releasing 'press releases' for Group FANs. But the main 
 reasons was Information Support. It was bad, when RCN printed what 
 they like, and people was not able to verify which information valid
 and which is not. Sodom created public relations and advertising 
 department to deal with FANs, and Press Releases. Press Releases 
 including common information about Label, News, Future Plans, and 
 Releases List. Plus, in the same area on the web site (Press Releases) 
 you can find some articles from the real magazines about Pirates. 
 It's fun to read, how _THEY_ trying to _DESCRIBE_ us.

  From: softhawk@*****.net
    To: Tok@TheSodom.com
  Date: Summer 1997.

    Would just like to comment on your history, and a bit about the scene.
 im part of a small couriering group on effnet, and can see that you too
 have a problem with the way in this scene has gone downhill. its all
 about numbers now, who can do the most and fastest. lost is the sense of
 loyalty and comradraire that were found in the bbs days of old. im 28
 now, been in this scene since i was 13 years old with a 300 baud modem
 hooked up to a local BBS long gone now.  your right about the new
 people, they really dont understand what its all about.  but, there are
 still small pockets of morality left in this scene, and your group
 sounds a lot like the one i am with now, and its good to see that the
 ways of old are not completely forgotten.<br><p>
