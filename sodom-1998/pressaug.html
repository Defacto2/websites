&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the first Sodom press release. Our idea for a press release
 is to allow our fans to gain a better knowledge of our group and our
 releases. We are trying to focus the group's main information source
 away from our traditional NFO file to our more presentable press
 releases.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The new look Sodom web page will open on August 25th, 1997.
 There promises to be many new supprises including new artwork, design
 and music.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Sodom is looking for a USA HQ. If anyone is interested please send
 your qwewies to deranged@thesodom.com with a topic of 'USA HQ'.

&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Corps</b> - You should all know Corps from the RCN emag, if you don't read
 some of their back issues. Corps is one of the best couriers in the
 scene today and it's a great pleasure that we anounce that Corps is
 joining our team.<br><Br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Phalycide</b> - come back from retirement, welcome to home pal. <br><Br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Tarkus</b> - As you can see, Sodom back rocking beats. We release so much
 because of our great suppliers, like Tarkus.<br><Br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Savage</b> - Our good old pal Savage is back supplying again. Get some
 killer titles for us Savvy man!<br><Br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Bender</b> - A great courier, and a supplier. We love to see these types of
 peoples in a group. We believe that Bender will be able prove he is
 a Sodom affilation.<br><Br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>The Vizitor</b> - Is a cracker, and realy good one at that. Sodom has a
 great reputation for it's cracking of releases and this reputation
 comes to us because of people like The Vizitor.
