US Government Fights Software Piracy - June 20, 1997

In a report recently disclosed by Attorney General Janet Reno, The U.S. 
Justice Department's "Operation Countercopy" campaign "represents one 
of the most important legal actions ever taken by the United States 
Government in the worldwide fight against piracy," said Douglas 
Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association.
"Pirates throughout the world, including cyberpirates, have always known
that the United States Government has the ability and the resources to
seek out and punish these copyright thieves," Lowenstein continued.
"Today's announcement shows they have the will to act. It means that
software pirates will not only have to dodge enforcement by industry,
but will also now have to look over their shoulders to see if the FBI
and the Justice Department are on their heels. Their comfort zone is
narrower today than yesterday and as these actions continue, pirates
will truly begin to feel the heat," Lowenstein said.

"Two of the cases announced by Attorney General Reno involve
entertainment software and we are pleased that information which we
provided to the government in recent months will help them prosecute
these cases," said Lowenstein."The IDSA will continue to provide the
FBI and other law enforcement agencies with the information and support
necessary to make these kinds of cases".
