 Introduction 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Welcome to the official Sodom press release. Our reasons for creating
 this is to allow our fans and the people who use our releases to gain
 a better knowledge of our group and our releases. We are going to focus
 the group's main information source away from the traditional NFO files
 to these more presentable press releases.


 Sodom News
 ~~~~~~~~~~

 We open 2nd Web Site: http://www.sodom.org, (there was a lot of reasons
 for it, one of the most important is: better ISP, and more features) 

 Http://www.thesodom.com still in the case, but we will use it from now
 for private side of Sodom. 
 
 We going to open "application month" from 1st December to 1st January. 
 Download our Application Generator (which was made in 1995), or fill out 
 our text form. 
 Only during this time, Sodom staff will be able to interview you, and
 decide, how good you are, and have you balls or not to join us. After 
 1st January, there will be big big big hangover, and 'shitloads' of 
 deals. So, please.. pay attention, if you dream to become one of the 
 SODOMERS on the Scene, and bring your soul under Sodom label, go met
 your dream.

 Group was overloaded with 'real life', that explain downhill in releasing. 
 We know what we doing, no panic. Sodom was in 'vacation' mood. Action 
 is what we are now. 
 
 Artworks still coming to 'Sodom Art Gallery', keep it up guys. But dont
 forget to include 'Artist' name, and 'Art group' if you think you want
 to be described under picture. It's realy nice to see your funky works
