Zippy for letting us use his well done history of the demoscene. <br>
<br>
The demoscene started in the early 80's when some hackers, and crackers <br>
started enjoying making cracktro's more than they did cracking programs. <br>
They started making them for fun, and after a while they had stopped <br>
cracking programs, and gone over to making cracktro's full-time. <br>
These soon turned into demos as they demonstrated the power of the computer, <br>
and programmer. Old crack-groups started turning into demo-groups, and <br>
thus, slowly the demo-scene emerged, as more and more hackers/crackers <br>
joined the fun. These are our underground roots, which is the reason <br>
that even today the demoscene is slightly underground, <br>
allthough perfectly legal. A lot of people are proud of the scene's <br>
background, and some are ashamed of it. I don't really mind either way, <br>
but I definetely think it should be remembered, when we start talking <br>
about commercial demos, sponsored demos, and stuff like that. <br>
<br>
The first demos were made for the AppleII, and the C64, then moving on to <br>
the Atari ST, and Amiga-machines. Now the IBM-compatible PC has become <br>
the largest demo-format (despite it's few registers compared to the Amiga), <br>
and there have even been a few demos for RISC-based computers. <br>
Most of the PC-demosceners have migrated from Amiga, or started out in <br>
the scene as PC-demosceners. If you think 3D in demos is something new, <br>
you can also think again. The first heavy use of line-vectors was in 1990, <br>
and shaded polygons followed a year or two later. <br>
This is why a lot of people are tired of vectors in demos. <br>
The demoscene started out as an allmost entirely Finnish scene, <br>
then growing to become a Scandinavian scene. It later also included an <br>
American scene, but they were kind of seperated from the Scandinavians. <br>
Today with the Internet becoming so large the scene is world-wide, <br>
and is represented, as far as I know in all continents, and a suprisingly <br>
large amount of countries. I have heard of a South-african scene, <br>
a Brazillian scene, and an Australian-scene in addition to the scene in <br>
Europe and Northern-America. It is still Europe, and North America that are <br>
the biggest parts of the scene. I'm including Scandinavia as a part of Europe. <br>
<br>
BBS's used to be the main meeting-place for sceners, <br>
apart from the demo-parties. With high phone-bills, <br>
this kept the Scandinavian Scene away from the American. <br>
This also resulted in more links to the computer-underground, <br>
as, well, nobody likes a high phone-bill.. <br>
With the arrival of the Internet, the DemoScene truly blossomed bringing <br>
unity to the worldwide DemoScene. Suddenly Europe layed eyes on American <br>
demos, and America... well we all know there's nothing like seeing a <br>
demo from Finland for the first time. There's something really strange <br>
about Finland. For some strange reason, most demos, and demo-groups from <br>
Finland, are amazingly good. This also helped the fact that the DemoScene <br>
is a very anti-rasistical environment. The scene is also mostly drug-free. <br>
Both facts are quite logical, when some of your best friends live in <br>
other continents it's not very natural to be rasistical, and when your <br>
hobby is using your brain to the maximum extent possible then you <br>
don't really feel like rotting it with drugs.. <br>
<br>
You no longer had to be connected to an active scene in your country <br>
to be a scener, neither was it nessecary to have been at <br>
one of the big scandinavian demo-parties, all you needed was access to the <br>
Internet. Don't get me wrong, nothing beats having a (relatively) local <br>
DemoScene-environment. It's great to be in a demo-group, and know that <br>
if you want to show something to the other people in your group, <br>
it's just a short train-ride away, or that you're at least in the same <br>
country, however, thanks to the Internet it is possible to have international <br>
groups spread all over the world. The Internet is really, really great. <br>
Not only because of stuff you can do with international groups, and stuff, <br>
but also how, if you upload you programs to an FTP-server, you theoretically <br>
have a potential audience of something like 30 million people, worldwide. <br>
<br>
However, we are now past the days of the Internet-boom, and following <br>
growth of the DemoScene, we have now entered into a bad period in history. <br>
The scene is fading.. This is a fact. Less and less new young people <br>
find out about, and decide to become a part of, the DemoScene, <br>
and the current elite is getting snapped up by the game-development companies. <br>
A lot of people blame this on Windows '95, and other people blame it <br>
on the scene for not adapting to Windows '95. What most people agree upon <br>
is that the arrival of Windows '95 has something to do with it. <br>
What makes a lot of people start out wanting to find out more about their <br>
machines, and perhaps start to code is fiddling around with drivers, <br>
learning DOS-commands, making boot-disks, and getting games to work. <br>
Windows '95 makes this all so simple. Click the icon, and the game <br>
starts, no questions asked, no puzzled users, no new little sceners. <br>
Some people claim that Windows '95 simply doesn't have the raw power that is <br>
needed to run good demos. *My opinion* is that anything you can do in <br>
Win '95 you can do faster in DOS. However the margins are getting smaller, <br>
especially if you're using DirectX6. The thing is that DOS, <br>
the way we know it, *is* dying, no question about it. <br>
If this new generation of Windows-users get their eyes on demos it might <br>
be all it takes to get them into the scene... <br>
<br>
I'd also like to mention that in 'normal society' every decade is visibly <br>
different from the previous, but it seems the demoscene has some sort <br>
of compressed history, because in the demoscene every single year <br>
is visibly different from the previous. Think about it. <br>
Look at demos from 1994,1995,1996,1997,1998, and you'll find that every year <br>
there are different things which the different demos have in common. <br>
In 1994 it was really common to use 320x400 images. Sound &amp; gfx was normally <br>
better than code. Effects were simpler, and gfx was better. More Amiga-like. <br>
In 1995 demos got more classy, and stylish. Code got better. <br>
In 1996 we saw the a lot of crappy object-shows + some good slideshows. <br>
In 1997 people started to use a *lot* of 3D. <br>
In 1998 it's popular to do colored lights transparent objects, fancy stuff. <br>
It is the year that Windows enters the scene,with the important tool <br>
DirectX to lead its way.1999 has started kind of the same way,waiting to see <br>
the most spectacular demos,hoping they come in TG99 or sooner...<br>
