<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">This is a small
explanation on what you have to do if you want<br>
to start coding on your computer.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">First off. Be
patient, and set yourself goals. What do<br>
you want to learn, what do you want to know how<br>
to do. How can you proceed to get the knowledge you<br>
need to do it. Think of these things. Then I would recommend<br>
you either start with C++/Visual C++ or ASM. Many would say<br>
that you maybe should try Pascal too.Since that is easier and<br>
also very associated with ASM. But I think there is more tutorials<br>
and possabilities with C++. ASM is very hard, so you should follow<br>
our guides down here,what to do with each program.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><u>Assembly</u></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">If you want to
learn Assembly,I suggest you buy an Assembly<br>
book.The book will also be useful for reference, so buying and <br>
not lending is preferable. Try to get &quot;A revolutionary guide to <br>
the Assembly Language&quot;&nbsp; (ISBN 1-874416-12-5) which is very<br>
good to learn ASM with.I will also put up a guide on this page<br>
to get the basics,which is hard enough to learn.And if you<br>
know the basics,the rest is easy. I just know the basics :)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><u>Pascal</u></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">If you want to
learn Pascal I suggest you also buy a book, to <br>
learn the most basic stuff. But if you are a good learner you<br>
can also jump right onto different coding tutorials that are<br>
many on the scene. Try <a href="http://www.hornet.org" target="_blank">www.hornet.org</a>
if its still up.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><u>C++</u></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">If you want to
learn C++ I can definately help you. I will base <br>
this page on C++ and will put up many tutorials. I have <br>
started out with these few tutorials for you starters :</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="5" color="#FFFFFF"><u>Downloads</u></font></p>

<p align="center"><u><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><a
href="LearnC21.zip">Learn C++ In 21 Days</a></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3"
color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font></u><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">This is a great guide to
learning the basics of C++ and <br>
understanding the way the coding work. I would<br>
recommend all wannabe C++ coders to get this and<br>
follow it truly.</font></p>

<p align="center"><u><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><a

color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font></u><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">This is different
sources,codes,referances and<br>
so on. Could be very useful for a beginning coder. I<br>
would recommend that you have the basic knowledge<br>
first though, cause otherwise you won't understand<br>
this stuff at all,which would be sad :)</font></p>

size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font></u><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">These are some great
sources which is explained in <br>
every step. Even a beginner can begin with these.<br>
They are originally in Pascal so Pascal users can get it<br>
too. Snowman (Hornet) have added C++ sources too<br>
it, so this one is a BIG winner, GO GET IT !!!!!!!</font></p>
