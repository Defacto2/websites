<font face=verdana size=4 color=gray><b><i>Cracktros</i></b><br>
<font face=verdana size=2 color=black>
Cracktros are an important part of the scene giving groups the opportunities to show off their talents to competing groups.
The first cracktros where done on the Commodore 64 in the early eighties, but it was Bentley Sidewell Productions and Crackers In Action which introduced the cracktros to the PC format.
Originally the cracktros where used to show off the cracker's coding ability, the eye candy and file size where most important.

<font face=verdana size=4 color=gray><b><i>Trainers</i></b><br>
<font face=verdana size=2 color=black>
Trainers are small programs that enable you to cheat within games.
These programs are usually loaded into the computer's memory and are triggered when you press selected keys during the game.
The keys gives you extra options not intended by the games creators usually to gain extra lives, skip levels, gain new weapons and powerups to make the game easier to play.

<font face=verdana size=4 color=gray><b><i>Electronic Magazines</i></b><br>
<font face=verdana size=2 color=black>
Electronic magazines are literally magazines, which instead of being on print, are programmed into code.
E-mags as they are affectionately know first appeared onto the PC scene in the very early nineties and where usually put out by groups on a very limited basis.
These magazines usually contained many different articles and interviews on many different items but they usually all had the scene as a focus.
The first non-group affiliated was Reality Check Network by Reality, which was also well known for creating as well as reporting the news.

<font face=verdana size=4 color=gray><b><i>NFO</i></b><br>
<font face=verdana size=2 color=black>
NFO is short for information and is now the term used when talking about the token text file that groups include within their releases.
Originally these text files only contained information about the crack included in the release.
But as time progressed more information was included such as short information about the game, keyboard commands and credits to the persons involved in bring the release to the public.
Eventually these text files became more formalised and where included as standard issue in every release a group would put out.

Competition can usually bring out the best and the worst in people.
And in the scene there is intense competition between the different groups all after the same release.
Here are some examples of the ugly side of the scene.
Warning some of the files in this section is not suitable for children (or for adults that matter).

<font face=verdana size=4 color=gray><b><i>Bulitien Board Systems</i></b><br>
<font face=verdana size=2 color=black>
Bulletin Board System's (BBS) where a separate component within the scene.
These where the focal point of the scene, groups would upload their releases to these BBS and download the competitors'.
They would leave messages on the networked message boards and also communicate with their own members as well as others.
Like a group BBS had their own organisers who would maintain the system and their own affiliations to obtain the releases quicker then the other boards within the area.
Up until the mid. nineties BBS where just as (if not more) important as the release groups.

<font face=verdana size=4 color=gray><b><i>Games Database</i></b><br>
<font face=verdana size=2 color=black>
When IBM released their first PC back in 1981 one of the first unofficial software releases for the machine was a game.
Even IBM themselves produced games for their machine for a while, as well as commissioning other developers to do the same.
Early PC games used text mode only before they ventured forth into the glorious CGA (Color Graphics Array) with its 4 on screen colors.
EGA (Extended Graphics Array) soon followed and by 1989 VGA (Video/Visual Graphics Array) surfaced.

<font face=verdana size=4 color=gray><b><i>Web Banners</i></b><br>
<font face=verdana size=2 color=black>
When the scene made the public move onto the Internet some groups thought it would be nice to have official group webpages.
While many of these pages served no real purpose, they where popular never the less. 
Banners where sometimes exchanged with other simular pages to help increase visits to the home page.
