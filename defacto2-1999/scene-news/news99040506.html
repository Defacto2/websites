Skill a long time leader of Class recently and unexpectedly called it quits. Some have speculated that he was pushed into quitting, but he was probably just bored with it. Class though has filled this opening with Prozac, a well-known contributor to the rip scene.

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="blue"><b>Sunday 20th June (10:15pm GMT) - Who Wins Total Annihilation?</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Total Annihilation Kingdoms by Cavedog was released by three different groups today, all with different sizes and modifications so who won in this instance?
Well The Players Club, Razor 1911 and Origin all released a version, two where over The Faction limits and the other was not. But also two of these groups are not members of The Faction.
<p>
Origin's release: Well after you go through another one of Origin's horrible longwinded NFO files you discover that it's not even a public release. This is what they say..<br>
"Therefore we are requesting that no traders spread this release as its for our ORIGIN sites only, as our users requested it.
If you want it on a local site, then request it and you may get lucky.
We repeat our traders will not spread this release to other sites so, do not bother to ask even!
But wait its over some gimpy limit we hear you cry? Well ORIGIN has no limits.
Although usually we do not go this high, there was such a demand for this game we decided to release it for our users pleasure.
This is not for the casual end user, unless they specifically want it and people can then get if they are lucky :P"<br>
From this you see it is not a public release, its for Origin internals only and it is not for the end user. So Origin are out.
<p>
The Players Club release: If you go by The Faction rules they are automatically out because their release is the equivalent of 79 disks. But if you don't go by The Faction rules (which other then Origin is who?) then TPC's release won as they got it out first.
<p>
Razor 1911's release: Razor's release is under The Faction limit plus it complies with all The Faction rules. There is nothing in The Faction rules that stipulates that re-sampling the terrain tiles makes this release a RAPE. Here is what the rules do say..<br>
"2. Every release under this limit will be a functionally and playably complete game. This means that included will be every component necessary for the successful completion of the game (every level, track, course and other NECESSARY component)."<br>
Even though the other Faction groups passed this up, Razor tackled this game and has won on technical and legal merits according to the agreed upon rules.
<p>

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="blue"><b>Sunday 20th June (10:15pm GMT) - Siege Goes Out On A High</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Siege the four year old and one of the most well known and respected util/app groups has called it quits. Here is what they had to say about it..
<p>
 This is indeed one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, but it is in
 the best interests of many.  Our NFO Group News always read:
<p>
    "SiEGE is dedicated to bringing you the best in PC utilities and     
     applications, while building upon the foundations of comradery and  
     good sportsmanship that our predecessors have laid down."            
<p>        
 This is something that we have been very proud of since 1995, when the group
 was founded by my mentor, the famous Hemp Hoodlum.  The time has come, where
 we feel we have reached our peak, and have provided you with a great service
 for quite some time now. It is time for us to call it a career, while still
 on top (in most peoples' minds and ours).  Rather than lingering around like
 so many other groups have in the past and continue to do, failing to produce
 much at all, we have decided to retire the Siege name.  It has indeed been a
 great run, and many many people have had a helping hand in this run.  It
 would not really be fair to mention only a few names here, so I would just
 like to thank each and every Siege member, past and present.  Without you,
 we would never have the recognition and status that we hold today.
<p>
 Thank you.
<p>
 Sincerely yours,
<p>
 David & Goliath
 (Honorary SiEGE BoSS!)

<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Dimension the one time great couring group was officially laid to rest this week. It was once considered one of the best courier groups, but in recent times it's lack of activity and the mass exodus of members made a shamble of the scene.<br>
While Dimension is officially dead two previously long lost names have resurfaced out of the rubble, Vice and Amnesia. Amnesia is probably the better known of the two seeing it was number one a few years ago but eventually died in a simular fashion to Dimension.

<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Isonews.com has received legal threats by lawyers representing Lucasfilm Ltd. warning them to remove a text file containing information on the illegal VCD release of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.
The lawyers claim the text file is advertising the sale of the illegal VCD while Isonews.com claim the file is just a text file included in the release of a freely distributed release of the program.
Scene-review.com has also received simular threats from Lucasfilm Ltd. representatives and has rejected their claims.
<p>
Speaking of Scene-review.com, they have also been warned by associates from Bleem! to remove a copy of a UCF crack for their Playstation emulator software. Scene-reviews has since headed their calls and removed the offending software. It wasn't very smart to offer it in the first place Scene Review.

It seems Origin made a mistake with their socalled crack for the Star Wars Racer, it is not required at all. Makes you wonder about a cracker's ability when they mistakenly claim a program is not cracked when it actually is. (And it makes you wonder about us when we post something about a patch that has already been nuked :)

Star Wars, Star Wars, Star Wars the most hyped movie of all time is now out on a computer near you. Razor 1911 has released both of Lucas Art's Star Wars titles to the masses. One is a racing game the other is a game based directly on the movie's story. Unfortunately for Razor some people have been expirencing problems with the racing came. They are saying it is not properly cracked, maybe Razor got to excited? No matter though, Origin has released a patch to crack the so-called problem.

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="blue"><b>Thursday 5th May (4:20pm GMT) - Windows 98 Part B Part 2</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Another twisted in the Win98B scandel, this time Core enters and concludes(?) the debate.
<pre><font face="arial" size="2">
Well, last days/weeks were really funny. GLoW and PFT released        
so called "Final" builds that were not final. Then PWA released       
two days ago the so called "real final" build "2222.2"! They          
released it on the day MS planned to ship the build for RTM.          
Well MS didn앖 send the build out for RTM on that day and delayed     
RTM again for 2 days - till 05/05/99. The repacked PWA version        
from yesterday is the same build.                                     
                                                                      
I think PWA was very afraid of COREUTiL압 coming "final" of           
Windows 98 Second Edition coz we hit them hard with our Office2k      
final (which they didn앖 accept as final coz the word "china" was     
added in their "final" build in a license agreement file - hehe).     
                                                                      
The PWA dudes told u in their Win98 SE .NFO that their wonderful      
final build doesn앖 need a serial number.  Well the "big" internal    
M$-PWA man must have been very afraid of losing again, otherwise      
I can앖 explain why he released a internal Microsoft "final"          
Test-Build Version to the public. Yes - PWA압 build is a internal     
Microsoft version of 2222.2 that was spread a week ago inside MS      
among MS employees to find last-minute bugs. This is the reason       
why u don앖 need to enter a serial number at installation!            
                                                                      
Microsoft uses in MS Windows 98 SE retail the MS PID v3.0             
registration method-type "5-5-5-5-5" which is nearly uncrackable.     
And if a MS-Internal gives out a serial, MS is able to locate the     
supplier coz the serial-owners are registered in their data-base!     
In the final build of Win98 SE retail changed the SKU                 
identification compared to the former test builds (like PFT, GLoW     
and so on).                                                           
                                                                      
MS declared 2222.2 as "final build" one day ago - internally.         
To make it short: If u have PWA`s build u have the internal(!)        
Microsoft build of Win98 SE 2222.2. This internal "final" build       
was changed today to fit it for the MS customers. The "real           
store final" will have of coz a serial number based on the            
pid3.0 serial checking even if it압 also build 2222.2. Do you         
really think MS will send Win98 SE out for RTM without serial???      
                                                                      
Our official full retail final of 2222.2 contains compared to the     
internal MS build of 2222.2 again "format.com, OEMSETUP.BIN and       
OEMSETUP.EXE." The final full retail CD contains these files!         
                                                                      
Also:                                                                 
                                                                      
    .\precopy2.cab different: e25740b2 vs. 4a752a87.                  
                                PWA        COREUTiL                   
                                                                      
PWA talked so much mungo bungo in their office2k release about        
"to be final or not to be final" and now u all can see that they      
have broken their own rules. We released with office2k a build        
that was technically & binary totally final. Just a license           
agreement file for customers changed with a single word. PWA did      
that not with win98 SE. But - pray to your PWA gods that exist        
since 1869 and always believe in their holy words!                    
                                                                      
It압 really funny to see what the scene has come to. Groups           
like GLoW or PFT release final after final with excuses "ooops,       
sorry - we thought this was final". And why in heaven did PWA         
release a MS-internal Win98 SE build of 2222.2 and called it          
REAL FINAL?! The PWA supplier knew that this build was internal       
and not the official store final that customers will buy. It압        
not hard to release a internal build if u are internal.               
                                                                      
From COREUTiL you get the version of Win98 SE that will hit           
US stores. We always wait till were sure that we have                
the binary(!) store final. Our build was send out today for           
RTM. It압 the OFFICIAL(!) final full retail version of Win98 SE       
- PWA압 is not - it압 a internal MS build with a few binary           
differences (3 files missing / other precopy2.cab).Nuke ours or       
keep it - we simply don앖 care, but we released the official          
full retail store final! U get 26 x 4.75 MB correctly packaged!       
                                                                      
Look at installation notes for the required serial.                   
                                                                      
Thank you.
