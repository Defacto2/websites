These post Christmas / pre New Years days can become a real bore for people who report on the scene, practically nothing of interests happens at all. But I will promise not to report on anymore Quake 2 patches even though another two have been release.<br>
Paradigm has decided to bless us with the very difficult to rip Wing Commander Prophecy (number 5 in the series). Produced by Electronic Arts/Origin and ripped down to 67 disks, this release has caused some controversys with some people believing  Wing Commander without the movies kills the game.

Well it looks like some groups are continuing to support their releases, Class must be congratulated on their continued cracks of Quake patches including their newest patch Quake 1.07.
<p>
<b>Friday 26th December</b>

Hmmmm well it's Friday the 26th, Boxing day and still no sign of Hybrid/Razor 1911's x-mas magazine. It looks like it will be a no show for 1997. I wonder what will happen to all it's articles? Speaking of which where is Paradigm's x-mas magazine?

Razor 1911 really know how to support their releases, today they release Age.Of.Empires.v1.0a.Update.CRACKED-RAZOR. I wonder if the other main game groups will start following suit? Maybe we could even return back to the early nineties when all the main groups released cracked patches and updates?<br>
Its Christmas already! Well Christmas eve anyway, so from all the people at Defacto 2, Sodom and myself we wish you all a Merry Christmas.

It has been quiet the past couple of days but don't worry if you want to break your bordom check out Scenelinks January edition at www.scenelink.org (click on features). It's well worth the read.

It seems Mr Mister has grown tired of editing Affinity, the only surviving emag from last year. According to Scenelink and #aft he has stopped editing the magazine for an indefinate ammount of time. But I assume he will still continue to code, the original reason why he started Affinity.

Yesterday while I was busy the group Heritage died after the group's leader called it quits. I don't remember exactly what these guys did but it must have been something because I do know the name. Well I suppose this is not the first group to ever die.<br>
Remember X-Wing Vs Tie Fighter the great multiplayer but not so good single player StarWars game? Well Hybrid have released the Balance of Power addon as a standalone product. This addon is ment to contain a great story line and cutscenes for the single player modes.

Nothing much happening today so I thought I might regurgitate some news that can be found in your local newspapers.
After US District Court judge Thomas Jackson's decision to temporally stop Microsoft shipping Ie4 with Windows 95 there are now doubts that Windows 98 may ship in April. Though more realistic people say it will most likely ship in two different versions, one with Ie4 and one with out. So you may see six different versions (2 full and 4 upgrade) of Windows 95 on the selves by the time it comes out.

I forgot the mention yesterday that if you want to contact RazorISO they have a public channel at #razoriso on efnet. But as with all group channels don't beg them for requests or files.

This is a little bit old but I missed it while I was away. Razor 1911 has formed a new division to cater for the growing ISO market. For those who don't know ISO's are basically complete CD versions that can be instantly burned onto a CD via a burner. Could this be the start of something simular to the CD-rip scene? Well Razor 1911 thinks so and to back this gamble up they are setting up a 60gig private ISO site exclusively for RazorISO. In the mean time you will just have to be content with their first release, Quake 2 ISO.

Seems Motiv8 the old skool courier group originally founded on the C64 has had a major split. Most of it's better members have quit, leaving the group fairly bare. I wonder if Mason will put this one to sleep?
<p>
<b>Thursday 11th December</b>
<p>
Well I'm back after a great holiday which saw me driving an unairconditioned van in 35c (95f) heat for 1,000kms (621miles).<br>
I suppose the major news witch i missed while I was away was Class's release of Quake II by iD. But now I'm back so expect the usual updates from now on.
<p>
<b>Friday 5th December</b>
<p>
I'm going away for a few days so don't expect any new posts for a little while.

<b>Wednesday 3nd December</b>
<p>
Since when is Australian Rules Football called Rugby? Well according to the reviewers at The Reviewers Guild they are the same thing, kind of like confusing Ice Hockey with Soccer.
<p>
<b>Tuesday 2nd December</b>
<p>
Id has completed Quake II and has sent the gold CD to Activision. So that means a group could release it in a few days but more realistically I would expect to see it in a week or two.<br>
Australian Rules football fans should check out Class's release of AFL 98 by EA Sports. Utilising the same game engine as the excellent Fifa 98 this one is definitely worth the 46 disks.<br>
Scenelink's December Issue is now online, check it out at <a href="http://www.scenelink.org">www.scenelink.org</a>.<br>
Unfortunately the page was down for a few days while I was offline but lucky for you it's now back ready to bring latest news.
