</B><P>Well I don't know where I have been for the past couple of days but I only just found out that The Game Review will be returning for summer (northern hemisphere). The Game Review back in 1996 and early last year the most popular game review magazine out there, managing to release over 50 issues. More information can be found at TGR's webpage - http://www.monmouth.com/~jionin<br>

</B><P>Well it's official, the respected oldschool utility group Sodom is dead. After a great deal of internal conflict within the group all the council members called it quits. This caused a domino type effect resulting in the affiliated sites to leave and then eventually most of the members. It's a terrible way for a group to go and we wish Saint Tok the best of luck in his real life pursuits.<br>

</B><P>We havn't seen a race like this between two major games groups for a while. This time it was Class vs Razor 1911 battling it out with M1 Tank Platton 2 by Microprose. Unfortunatly for Class, Razor had a major head start and managed to bet them on almost all the major sites. But that didn't keep Class down for long for no sooner did they loose this release they came back with Die By The Sword (c) Interplay.<br>

</B><P>About 20 minutes ago VDR Lake (one of the top five sites in the world) announced that it had dropped it's utility WHQ affiliation with Sodom and has left the group. The reason for the departure are personal differences between the siteops and the Sodom leader.<br>

</B><P>Poor Paradigm, it has always been considered one of the more friendlier groups out there, but even they get annoyed by repetitive questions from clueless people. #paradigm [+stn]: VR Sports Power Boat Racing (c) Interplay [xx/21] yes -3dfx and shit<br>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Monday 18th March (21:50 GMT)</P>
</B><P>There is not much going on lately except for the unfortunate closure of sites. The news of late is the mysterious closure of The Prophecy, a site affiliated with Millennium.<br>

</B><P>BLZ a site considered in the 'top 15 best sites in the world' bracket was stolen today. It is down indefinitely as it is assumed the whole box was taken.<br>

</B><P>Yesterday Razor released the highly anticipated Star Wars strategy game, Star Wars: Rebellion by Lucas Arts (59 disks).<br>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Friday 6th March (15:00 GMT)</P>
</B><P>The old school utility group 2000AD has called it quits. Leddy and co. have left to form a new group called Nobliege. As of yet no reason has been given for the move.<br>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Wednesday 4th March</P>
</B><P>Talk about jack shite going on, this is getting quite said. Yes I could mention something about narcing, but thats not my thing. At least not at the moment, so I am suck with nothing to tell you guys.<br>
If you are really bored you can always read this weeks Weekly Courier Report (out yesterday) or catch up on the games you missed with Just The Facts (out a couple of days ago).
