<p><font face="arial" size="2">
It seems we owe GameOver.net an apology for yesterday's article about a report on their pages.
The report/article was infact an anonymous email that was not intended for public consumption.
GameOver.net never had any intention of releasing this to the public and are disappointed that the public obtained the url.

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>Friday 13nd November (7:05pm GMT) - Half-Life Is BETA!</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
The Class release of Half-Life today (yet another over-hyped fps game) is now confirmed as beta.
The Class build is 738 while the final build is 742. This is another slap in the face for the group who have already had a shocking month. They also admit breaking the FACTION rule #1 but they claim it was for the good of the scene. But I say whats the point of creating rules if you do not follow or enforce them?
<p>
Here is an extract from their NFO ..<br>
  We are well aware of the packaged  size of this game and we are aware
  that  it is in  violation of guideline #1 of  the agreed-upon FACTION
  10 point program, but we recognize a major title  when we see one and
  there is no better way to deliver a title of this stature than in its
  most  complete form. Some groups  would motion to  remove multiplayer
  levels  or whatnot, in  order to  make it a  legitimate  release that
  could be counted in  charts etc. Fortunately  for the  end-user, that
  is not OUR  priority, and  we sincerly  believe that gamers out there
  who  have been  waiting  for this  game are  willing to get it at the
  expense  of a few  hours and or a $50 dollar phone bill in Europe.
  There is NO better way to bring this game down in size while main-
  taining the utmost level of playability, functionality and enjoya-
  bility that this game deserves. So as far as credit in the game-charts
  goes, we say fuck-it. Nuke this game if you'd rather not see it on
  your respective sites. The rest of us will enjoy this long-awaited,
  stellar title. Noone can deny that this is what common sense dictates.
  Enjoy the game and expect more from your dependable friends who have
  brought you some of the greatest FPS games of all time, including
  QUAKE 2 and UNREAL... CLASS PC.

Oh it also seems when you use Sierra's online gaming server for multiplayer games the server logs some of your information. Sierra doing a Blizzard I wonder?

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>Thursday 12nd November (7:10pm GMT) - No So Secret Article</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Game-over.net has caused uproar among the scene by putting online an article about the scene. The article contained so much information that it might as well have been titled ‘The Newbies Guild To The Games Scene'. The article mentioned how-tos, group names, releases even group irc channels.
<p>
Many groups are highly aggravated at this article with many people now threatening a boycott of game-over.net (or worse). 
Due to a lack of communication within the group, some members claimed that the article was never meant to be put online.
Even though it was complete and ready, with it's own custom graphics etc. 
But the persons who did published and uploaded this article, did it obviously without giving it too much thought.
<p>
The article was located at http://www.game-over.net/feature/november/truth/ but has since been erased due to many complaints.

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>Thursday 5th November (5:55pm GMT) - Razor Violates New Rules?</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
There has been an uproar today after Class nuked Razor's release of Sin, claiming it was a rape and broke the new FACTION rules.
Razor released the game at 50 28.8 disks and in the original release ripped the movies, speech and music. Now here is the tricky part they also took out some of the multiplayer and training maps. Razor then went on to release a music addon at 21 28.8 disks and a Speech and Misc (missing maps) addon at 24 28.8 disks.
Now here are the FACTION rules that are affected ..
<p>
2. Every release under this limit will be a functionally and playable complete game. This means that included will be every component necessary for the successful completion of the game (every level, track, course and other NECESSARY component).
<p>
> While Razor has removed some multiplayer levels the game is still functional and playable right to the end. All the necessary components are included.
<p>
5. Only 2 Add-Ons should be released per game. Each Add-On should be no more than 25 x 2.88 megabyte archives.
<p>
> There are only two addons for this release and both are under the 25 disk limit.
<p>
So as you can see Class had no reason to nuke Razor's release. Some people (though we do not) have been saying that certain people in Class are being nothing more then cry-babies, who are angry that they did not get their way.
