Origin in their latest release as included a massive <a target="_blank" href="nfo/0019.txt">NFO</a> that claims that Class's SC3000 release is a complete dupe of their release. Then it goes on about the even older topic of Class running Just The Facts.

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="black"><b>Sunday 24th January (1:20am GMT) - Simcity 3000 Final</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Class has released a patch (450kb) for Origin's release of Sim City 3000.
The fix converts Origin's release to the store release.
If you didn't download the Origin release Class also released the Sim City 3000 store edition at just under 50 disks.
<p>
Below is what Class has to say about Origin's release of Sim City 3000.
<p>
<pre><font face=arial size=1>
  Here  is the "100% FINAL STORE BOXED COPY RETAIL VERSION" of  Sim City 3000.
  This is  version SC3final1230981.rc2, while  the ORIGIN and IND release  are
  both version SC3KBeta102991.1.  An interesting side note, in the FINAL .EXE,
  there is a  portion which states "The 30 day expiration of  this pre-release
  has expired."  However, in the  ORIGIN release, the .EXE has been modified &
  this whole sentence has been 00'd out.  In the DVNISO .EXE, it says "Another
  fine DVNISO release."  This was obviously done in an attempt to cover up the
  fact each group knew it was indeed not the FINAL copy.  Rest assured this is
  not a pre-release.
<p>
  So  upon reflection, what  have we  observed?  We've  watched ORIGIN  lie to
  its  competition  and  the  public  about  the reason for  their release  of
  SC3K saying BETA in the  version  window.  We've watched them try to in turn
  cover  their tracks by  removing text  from the .EXE, that in  fact is  also
  found  in  the STORE  FINAL game.  Last but  not least,  we  were forced  to
  endure another  unbearable  ORIGIN.NFO in  which they  mutilate the  English
  language  through  their whining  over points  they were  unable to score in
  the charts.  If they put  half as much  time into  examining  their releases
  as  they put  into  writing  their  gibberish  NFOs, perhaps  they  would in
  fact earn points in the charts.  To OGN: You're not fooling anyone...
<p>
  We  at CLASS chose  to do  a BETA TO  FINAL UPDATE  PATCH as well  as a FULL
  STORE   FINAL  RELEASE,  because  we  are  aware  that  some  of   you  have
  unknowingly  downloaded the  ORIGIN  BETA  while  others were not  given the
  chance  because ORIGIN's OVER THE LIMIT, BETA  was removed  from most sites.
  Those who  have the ORIGIN  release but  want to  avoid the  possibility  of
  problems  such as, game updates  not working, multiplayer incompatibilities,
  and the game  eventually  expiring, can  grab the  BETA TO FINAL  UPDATE and
  rest easy.  Those  who missed  the game  altogether, waiting  for the final,
  can grab the FULL RELEASE and see what they've been missing.  Enjoy!

Sim City 3000 is apparently beta. It has been confirmed by many people of Origin's release of this game that if you hold down Ctrl Alt V (for version) you get the following reply ..<br>

OEM VERSION: SC3KBeta102991.1<br>
Note at this time even facing this evidence Origin are denying that it is a beta.

The site will feature current news from across the art, demo, and warez scenes, as well as occasional interviews and articles.
The original founders, neofish9 and dezigner, are overseeing the redesign, but plan to retire from active service following the reopening.

<p><font face="arial" size="2">
You may have noticed that Origin's release of Sim City 3000 is 56 disks. Thankfully Origin is not a member of the Faction and so they can (if they choose) release what they want at what they feel is an acceptable size.
Like Mindseye said in his article it is not about following X rules but rather getting the software out the most efficient way and today you see that with Sim City 3000.
While obviously Faction sites (pdm, cls, rzr) are going to nuke and discredit this release some more open minded sites have accepted it.

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="black"><b>Thursday 14th January (12:00am GMT) - Origin Blasts JTF</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Origin have been making a lot of news today with the most recent being the accusations of the JTF conspiracies.
This article in the Simcity and Liath NFOs is really not worth reading about as it just rambles on in a typical Cypher fashion on how everyone sucks but themselves.
I generally gives examples on what Cypher thinks his Origin released games should have scored, not much in the way of compelling evidence.
I’m just curious as I thought it was common knowledge that JTF was a Class biased publication? So why are Origin dribbling this rubbish now, maybe because they finally have some half decent releases?

<p><font face="arial" size="2">
If you never read another scene related article...
read this one.
<p>
The scene... whats left of it. I was reading through my mails the other day when I
read a reply to a mail I wrote saying "I really wish there was some one public 
sounding board where I could let off some steam about a few things in the scene
that have simply gotten out of hand..." I got a reply from a member of my group who
directed me to a few URL's... 3 in fact... One of them I should have known about,
www.defacto2.net's Forum... I should have known about it since I have been in DF2
since its upstart as an art group, but things mellowed for a while and I somehow
dropped out of contact, anyhow, as I said there were 3 links... The DF2 link,
One to a site where there was a full blown idiot fest going on where ChinaBlu was
bieng called a bitch and cunt and everything else that a mature 12 year old can think
of to call some one whos success intimidates them. That was not for me...
The other had very little "Utilz" related info and seemed to be moderated by someone
who assumed the scene was comprised of "The gamez groups" and those other little groups
that didnt really need to be represented... 
<p>
 So my itchy fingers and burning soul turned towards the lesser of 3 evils... Defacto2's
board was newly started, with very few posts, but Ippgi had at least made a few topics
and initial posts to get people going... But what locked me to it was this forum called 
"The Utilz, Cracking, and Appz scene" I posted this message:
<p>
"The very title of this area is a horrendous example of scene rules gone awry... 
<p>
#1 tell me the difference between an App and a Util.. if you say Pagemaker is an App and 
Partition Magic is a Util.. then show me one "Utils" group that wouldnt release both. 
Its crap. 
<p>
To take it further and clarify what I mean... your little scene rules have forced people 
to make up senseless crap and confuse the piss out of everyone. Utils vs. Cracking Affil 
means this: <br>
---> "I need an excuse for double grouping" 
<p>
What does a utils group do with thier utils? <br>
THEY CRACK THEM. <br>
What does a cracking group crack? <br>
UTILZ. <br>
Get the point? All release groups are cracking groups. Games groups CRACK Utilz groups CRACK.. 
Everyone is a cracking affil. Gimme a hammer so I can pound it into your thick skulls. 
<p>
and now I hear "But if they only crack shareware?" 
Then they are a WEAK utilz group. Get a supplier and some better crackers and try and compete, 
otherwise sit there and fart around... but you are still a UTILS group if thats what you crack. 
<p>
Log onto any decent site... you get two dirs to up into.. 
<p>
What are they? 
<p>
/GAMES/ <br>
/UTILS/ <br>
Where the hell is /CRACKS/ ? It doesnt exist cause everyone would laugh at the asshole siteop 
who made that dir. 
<p>
Not to sound pissed off but enuf is enuf already with the damn rules and leeto-bullshit.
<p>
//MindsEye - Rebels"
<p>
I put my email on the message, gladly ready to swap punches with anyone who had something to
say against my hard facts. I expected the mails to come.. but none did. Not yet anyway.. I expect 
there will be some.. I will also hasten to assume that they will come from new generation warez
kids who were born with windows and assume computers have always had a mouse. They say that this 
generation is inheriting the scene.... well... after I die maybey. But they have had thier chance 
in my eyes. I dont want rules on releasing anymore than I want laws on the Internet. These things
are ours. We were here first. We built it. They havent even taken the time to TRY to understand it.
It began so beautifully... Anarchistic. Us against them, the companies trying to bleed us dry with
rediculous software costs. And now its us vs. this unknown mess of crap and insecurity. Before you
had to earn your place in the ranks... show what you were made of... Now you only need a cable modem
and 1/4 of a brain and poof! you're Leet! Start a group... take some name that sounds cool...
Fairlight! That sounds cool... Hmm.. I may have heard of that but fuck it.. there is noone using it
now... 
<p>
The rules in the beginning were simple... Dont be stupid. If you are intelligent then you will do
things in a way that will be most efficient... that is leet. If you uploaded crap with no .DIZ so
that no one knew how many disks were in the release you were lame.. why? cause you broke the level
of efficiency. Not because you broke a rule some moron made... but because there was a better way
and the truly leet always knew what the better way was and used it, they used thier heads. 
Thats all there is to it.
<p>
I know what every 14 year old who only knows the word "warez" to describe the scene is thinking right 
now as they read this article... "fuck you old man... die already... theres a new sherrif in town" and
to that my reply is... you gotta outwit the old sherrif son.. and to be honest.. I dont think ya got 
the goods. If you had your new "systems" would work. And if you take a long hard look at the leadership
of the successful groups in the scene these days I think you will find an "old schooler" at the helm
of each and every one of em. Someone who very probably did binary to hexadecimal conversion, probably 
has typed some of his first games into his C=64 line for line by hand, someone who knows how his machine,
how his network, and how the internet in generall works, someone who made tones into phones to make free
phonecalls from usa to france to sit on QSD in paris or Lutzfer in germany, the predecessors of todays
IRC.. One room.. no ops... anarchy. We were there.. and we are still here.. behind every group in the 
scene that is successful... And we have no intention of letting a bunch of snot nosed windows punks
trash what we have built. Are you 14 and thinking "but I would love to learn all that stuff.. I am open
minded.. I dont think I am god with a keyboard" Then theres a place for you in digital heaven my son...
Its you we will lead into the light... it is you who will inherit the kingdom... OUR scene... Treat it
well and remember these simple rules:
<p>
1- a real group releases to get warez to the people, and not to show off to each other or look good 
   on lists.
<p>
2- a truly leet group is a group that is the most efficient -in the computer world its brains that count.
   Efficiency gives results, and results are what make you.
<p>
3- regardless of what anyone says the 3rd rule is very important... There are no rules. Fuck'em. Dont let 
   anyone tell you what to do, what to release, how to release it... BUT make sure that if you are going to
   go out of the main stream (that which has proven to be the fastest and most intelligent) that your way is
   faster and smarter or they will eat you alive.
<p>
Live on the edge... Make it happen. <br>
And you old schoolers... Dont give up on "our scene" it isnt dead... you are.. wake the fuck up, take some
initiative, lets straighten this shit out... and if we are going to just give the scene to the next generation
then lets give em a scene that fucking works. Thats fun. Like we had.

Orm's ISO News: Covers all you would want to know about the ISO scene, both games and utilities.<br>
Released HQ: Inspired by TCA, though I find it's easier on the eyes (and sometimes has more updates). Though they do tend to over hype many items with *EXCLUSIVE* etc a bit too often.<br>
Scene Review: Formed by a ex-KingXTC member, also has simular content. Though unlike KingXTC it is being updated.<br>
The W**** Fix0r: I can't mention it's name because we are after a new advertiser at the moment. This is also another KingXTC clone with NFOs, patches, etc.<br>
Prozac's Personal Game Reviews: Another gaming report done by the well known supplier/writter Prozac, the difference with this though is that it will be also in html format.<br>
