<br><PRE><font face="arial" size="2">
With this email I am announcing my retirement from trsi. In the following lines
I want to write down some reasons why I am doing this step, same like telling
you all what I think actually of trsi and its leadership. So its up to you if
you want to continue reading and get to know the truth of if you want to stop
here...
The main reason why I am quitting the group is the ignorance and the
god-like-behaviour of the self-righteous leader Sauron. As you know some time
ago there was something like a coop between trsi and razor and because of this
he was added to the razor mailing list. But instead of doing something like
exchange informations the very smart Sauron just forwarded all razor interal
informations to gain own profit of it and maybe also because he was thinking
nobody would notice his 'clever' game. Since I am also added to the trsi and
razor mailing list I could have done the same thing, giving group-related
informations to another group, but by not doing such things you usally show that
you have honor and you are loyal to your group and all its coop partners. I
guess last two traits of character dont seem anything to mean to the actual trsi
pc leader. After Sauron forwarded something like the 15th message containing
sensitive material I also took a trsi email including informations concerning a
maybe upcoming release and send it to the razor mailing list to show Sauron that
we are able to do the same thing. The reaction of Sauron was interesting.
Instead ot talking to me and discuss the problem he just removed me (as a trsi
members) from the trsi mailing list. After this I spoke to him and also send him
an email and told him to re-add me to the mailing list else he can see the next
email as my retirement. The response to this mail is attached at the end.
Unfortunately its in german so that I have quote and translate the main
sentences now.
The main content in his email is that he only can see it as joke that I ask for
re-adding to the mailing list, I am not in the position to demand something yet.
If I continue asking something like that, HE (the almighty trsi pc world leader
himself) will remove me from the group. He noticed that I am in the group for 6
months now and I dont have done anything yet, 0 Intros and 0 Installers. Beside
this he is of the opinion that I am lying when I say there is a nearly finished
trsi intro existing.
I dont want to waste too much words on his stupid arguments but I have to say
atleast some words. The (for him) not-exisiting win32 intro is attached to this
email, as said its finished, the only thing which is missing is the music but
that is because of some reasons for which I am not responsible. Even when there
would be nothing at all and I would have been lazy for all my membership time he
shouldnt complain, because he forgot that beside I did nothing I also never took
anything from trsi in exchange. I never used trsi bouncers, sites or @trsi.de
email adresses. Maybe he would have a right to complain about my - in his eyes -
not exisiting work, but as said I never took ANYTHING from trsi in exchange for
my work.

So far to my reasons to leave trsi. For those who are still interested in
continue reading I want to tell my opinion about the fact how I see trsi and his
leaders nowadays. For those who dont know me I want to introduce myself a little
bit, in order that you will see that I know what I am talking about. I guess I
am in the scene for something like 8 years now. I was already in trsi a few
years ago, and that not just for 6 months - no, it were 2 whole years in which I
did for trsi more then 16 intros. Beside this I also had contact to trsi in the
good old amiga-times, when there were coops between trsi & dytec and trsi & skid
row. Btw I am not sure at all if Sauron know what Amiga means.. Try to ask him.
Or better not. But lets continue... I just were two years in trsi pc because
after that time most of the members lost interest and quit the group. The
remaining members decided to retire also from trsi, waiting for the day that old
members will return to awake the group from its sleep. I guess most people know
that this never would happen again. There were several tries of some lamers who
just wanted to rebuild the group in order to be connected to the fame of the
group, but not real members at all. Not so long ago there were the step to
rebuild trsi on pc made by mc loud & co., members from amiga - but OLD & REAL
members in my eyes. In the hope that everything would become like it was some
years ago I also joined to help trsi to get back the status from the old days.
To rebuild trsi on pc was a good idea but its impossible without the old
members, members who bring the spirit of the old days back into the group. I
guess there might be a little bit of this spirit around, but thats not in trsi
pc. This spirit you can find only in members who know what trsi really means.
When I look to the membership of trsi these days I just can say that it is very
sad. I dont see ANY old members of the trsi pc group and I guess nobody will
care when the only real member now leaves. The members of trsi pc are not
responsible for what do they do, it was Sauron who took them into the group. I
dont want to ask how he managed to become pc leader, I guess he decided it one
night for himself. When I look back some months ago.. or lets say 1 year - who
knewed Sauron there? Was he even active? In which group? What are his references
which qualifes him as leader? Uh-Uh I better dont continue asking, the answer
might hurt alot. However, trsi pc is now a patch/beta releasing group... not
because of the members, they try their best, but its because of the organisation
for which only the leader is responsible. I dont know if you knew it, but in
trsi pc never was only one guy who told what to do or what not to do. Some years
ago when there were real members in trsi pc there was a seniorship who decided
everything together, not just one god-like-person how Sauron.

I feel sorry for the old Amiga/N64 trsi members who hoped that trsi pc would
become a success. Trsi was unique some years ago, world leading. Nowadays trsi
pc even cant compete with the other groups in Germany, and I dont even speak of
europe or worldwide presentation. Trsi only has its name and the fame of lost
days, that is all. To get trsi back to life its neccessary to find old members,
not just some trsi-wanna-be-members like Sauron. I dont know who can do such
work, but for sure not Sauron, he is too young and I wonder how old he was like
5 years ago when Trsi pc had its high time.. maybe he was 8-9 or even 10 years
?!. But who cares...

I cant say it was a nice time in trsi pc because I usally dont lie, the only
time that was good was when the group tried to start again, when old amiga
members where present and had influence. I hope that nobody will feel offended
and especially not Sauron. These words were neccessary and I dont know who else
know trsi that good and have the courage to tell him what his eyes cant see. I
guess he will continue living in his own small world instead of seeing that he
failed to get back life to trsi. I wonder what he will do in another 5 years but
I am not sure if he will be around then. Even when it takes 5, 6 or 7 years -
when some old pc members decide to return I will be one of them and then we will
show that at least the old and real members still know what the spirit means.

For comments I am ofcourse open and you may feel free to email me. I guess I
will not respond on any comments of Sauron regarding this letter, especially not
when they are written in german. I guess a group leader should be able to speak
english and argue in another language then his own ;)

PS: My retirement from trsi doesnt mean retirement from the scene at all. I will
stay in my favourite group Razor 1911 who honors its members and give them what
they deserve. Razor dont treat old and loyal members like trsi does under its
'perfect' pc leadership. The intro attached to this mail wont be used for trsi
for sure, it just needs 2 minutes to exchange the logo. Sorry Sauron but I guess
you have to find another way to get fame back to the group. I hope this email
could open the eyes of some people, if you want to complain write to
sggr@gmx.net.

The statement is posted below.<p>"OK. now for the record, here is my take on the situation. First, if i had not said what i did, someone else would have most definately exacerbated the situation. Say, some 14 yr. old punk from say #vcd or some lamer that idles in #isonews did it. Told the reporter that ppl actually laughed at Lucas, rather than "scared away some pirates and couriers", that was good dis-information to help protect the scene. I told that reporter more bullshit than you guys could possibly imagine, everything from the scene consisting of only 200-250 ppl to the fact that vcd groups just pick up bootlegs off the streets of new york and distribute them, that they dont do the pirating and all sorts of shit. LOOK at what i was quoted saying, i didnt give them ANYTHING accurate about how shit actually works. And what i did give him was the truth that lucas fucked himself and a lie about about lucas scared people. there are also at least 6 other sources for that article including someone who had actually dl'ed a vcd before, etc....(i straight up told him i am not a member of the scene whatsoever, no group affils, etc...) So, i didnt provide all that info. He would have gotten from one source or another.Second, the fact that isonews.com was mentioned is inevitable, we've been mentioned in other news stories without being confronted by the author. The fact is, isonews.com gets between 9,000-13,000 hits/day and people obviously know about its existance. We do not do anything illegal here and if you were smart, you would not post anything in this forum that is of any relevance to any illegalities. thats your own damn fault. This page has seriously helped shape the iso scene whether the top dogs and old farts admit it or not and is completely legal. so for your weak ploys claiming i did it for fame, shut up. I did it so they really wouldnt get the full picture, and at the same time, i hardly revealed anything at all. Besides, isonews.com is already famous. The author researched well and had many, many sources. Finally, all i can do is tell you to re-read again and again the two small sections im involved in, those are the only contributions i made that were published and you will realize that you are overreacting. The article accurately portrayed steps in how things work, but that info could have been picked up from anywhere (irc/the web/msg boards, etc). period. it didnt say anything about suppliers or where to get files or how to contact groups and if you think for a second they reported any "new" info to the feds, you seriously have a disorder. It definately did not implicate any one person whatsoever.Thats all i can think of at the moment. Flame away, but read, re-read the sections i was responsible for and think "what if someone else had done it", ... before you go blabbing your mouth.<br>-krazy8"<p>I think personally the biggest problem with the NYT article was the timing. It doesnt help after the recent French busts and especially after the USA narcing.</font><p><ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="blue"><b>Friday 30th July (11:13am GMT) - New York Times Article</b></font></ul><p><font face="arial" size="2">The New York Times "on the web" technology section contains an article about the recent upsurge in online piracy of Hollywood films.

Problems of the DVN-release:  - the game will crash when it doesn't find certain movies, you'll get a "Critical Error: Can't read file ..."- the game has a cd-check after about 90 minutes of gameplay (see your-self with the included savegam1.zip in the first disk)- the game has another sneaky check after about 8 hours of gameplay- the game itself deletes all savegames (check with savegam2.zip)- the game is practically unplayable with the small cutscenes ripped DVN might have avoided all these problems if they had spent either more time testing their release or just looking at what happened with the german release of the game, which needed a bunch of fixes.But DVNs history proves that they simply do not have the skills or even the will to fix their own mistakes.Because a simple fix will not make the DVN-release playable (without the cutscenes) we decided to do a full working release of this quite good trade simulation/strategy-game, including the cutscenes.<p></font></td></tr></table></BODY></HTML>
