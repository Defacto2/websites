          small New York new-media company enjoyed his own private screening of 
          "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me." The film's sound fell 
          somewhere between hollow and muffled. The picture, washed out and 
          slightly murky, looked like a videotape copy of a public access 
          television show.

                piracy has attracted the attention of movie studios. </FONT>

          one-man audience wasn't too disappointed, considering that he didn't 
          pay to see the film in a theater; he had downloaded and played a 
          pirate version on his desktop. 
          <P>"I'm not going to see this in the theater -- it's funny, but not 
          that funny," said the employee, who asked that his name not be used 
          because, by downloading an illegal copy of the "Austin Powers" sequel, 
          he is breaking copyright laws and he does not want to incur the wrath 
          of the film's producers. 
          <P>What made his private screenings possible was MPEG, a digital file 
          format for compressing and playing video and audio that could be to 
          the movie industry was the MP3 format was to the recording industry. 
          MPEG (named for the Motion Picture Experts Group, which developed it) 
          also makes it possible to swap video files, including illegally copied 
          versions of current films, over the Internet. MPEG's of pirated films 
          are created from illegally obtained copies; the digitized files can 
          then be played on a computer with MPEG-player software like Quicktime 
          or Windows Media Player and "burned" on a recordable disk called a 
          VCD. 
          <P>
          <P>Movies like "Summer of Sam," "Eyes Wide Shut" and "American Pie" 
          have been made available online within days and sometimes hours of 
          their release. (Pirates also swap online copies of films that have 
          been released on video or DVD, although they are less popular than 
          first-run films.) Some films, like "The Blair Witch Project," appeared 
          illegally on the Internet before being released in theaters. 
          <P>
          <P>MPEG technology is obviously of great interest to Hollywood. The 
          Internet aside, movie pirating costs the seven major American movie 
          studios about $250 million domestically and $2 billion to $3 billion 
          internationally. The Net could add a lot to the tally as cable modems 
          and other high-speed connections become more plentiful, making the 
          proliferation of illegal video copies easier. 
          <P>"The fact that movies can be disseminated digitally on the 
          Internet, illegally, is a serious concern," said Gordon Radley, 
          president of Lucasfilm, producers of "Star Wars: Episode I -- The 
          Phantom Menace," perhaps the most widely pirated film to date. "Our 
          copyright laws have been there since the time of the Constitution. 
          <P>Just because there's a new technological advancement doesn't change 
          things in any way." 
          <P>Taking a lesson from the music industry's initial 
          caught-in-the-headlights approach to MP3, the Motion Picture 
          Association of America plans to move quickly to stop the illicit 
          trading. For the most part, MPEG pirates are not making money from 
          putting films on the Internet. They do it for one-upmanship and 
          bragging rights. Web sites like ISO News (<A 
          href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/07/circuits/articles/#1">http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/07/circuits/articles/#1</A>) 
          and Dupecheck (<A 
          href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/07/circuits/articles/#1"> 
          www.dupecheck.com</A>) review the pirates' releases and gossip about 
          their exploits as if they were celebrities (the sites do not offer 
          pirated material for downloading). 
          <P>No hard figures exist on the number of pirated films or the pirates 
          who make them. According to the founder of Dupecheck (who goes by the 
          on-screen name Werner &amp; Tardy), there are 2,000 to 2,500 "elite" 
          traders -- pirates who regularly upload and trade films. But the 
          Dupecheck site itself is now receiving as many as 30,000 hits a day, 
          which could be a sign that interest in online film copies is set to 
          explode. 
          <P>As with MP3, video piracy could expand from a geek hobby to a real 
          business. Anyone with a VCR, a computer and an MPEG encoder card or 
          external adapter, which can cost as little as $250, can become a mogul 
          in the counter-Hollywood of pirating. 
          <P>Already, a Web site called VCD-Import, based in Britain, sells VCD 
          copies of current films like "The General's Daughter" and "Wild, Wild 
          West" for $5 apiece. The founder of VCD-Import, who would identify 
          himself only as Paul, wrote via e-mail that he gets 750 to 1,000 
          orders a day. 
          <P>"I am well aware it is illegal in the U.K. to sell such items," 
          Paul wrote. "But it is simply business and keeping up with the demand 
          for VCD's." He said British authorities have pressured his payment 
          provider to turn over customer information. <BR><NYT_INLINEBLURB

          <P>Digital pirate versions of films first appeared on covert IRC 
          (Internet Relay Chat) channels and private FTP networks in early 1997. 
          Typically, they were produced from copies of the original film, either 
          made with camcorders smuggled into theaters or the more prized 
          "screener" tapes intended for movie executives and reviewers. Many are 
          simply filmed by someone with a digital videocamera smuggled into the 
          theater. Video pirates then convert these duplicates into MPEG-1 files 
          of 500 to 600 megabytes apiece, which are compressed and chopped into 
          15- to 20-megabyte morsels with archiving software to ease the 
          download. 
          <P>Even then, downloading a movie can still take from two hours to two 
          days depending on the file size and bandwidth constraints on either 
          end. The employee who viewed the new "Austin Powers" movie first had 
          to retrieve it: even with a T-1 line, the film, which weighed in at 
          876 megabytes when reassembled, took seven hours to download. 
          <P>
          <P>There are 15 to 20 groups, with names like Eviliso and VCD-Europe, 
          that are regularly found on pirate Web sites. (Eviliso digitally 
          brands its copies with a letter Z that appears in the corner of the 
          screen.) The groups tend to distribute their goods through "couriers" 
          who often have little direct contact with them. From their large FTP 
          sites, these middlemen pass the data along to friends and carefully 
          screened acquaintances who move them further down the trough. Like the 
          pirates, the couriers do this largely for bragging rights, not money. 
          <P>"It requires a tremendous amount of time online and lots of 
          dedication," a courier said by e-mail. He estimates that he spends 6 
          to 10 hours a day at it, "but at the moment, I don't have anything 
          better to do." 
          <P>After a few days, the files make their way to IRC, the chaotic 
          collection of chat channels where VCD aficionados loiter to see who 
          has a movie, game or other software they are willing to trade. Pirated 
          "warez" of all sorts are the currency of this virtual economy, and 
          there is lots of business for the person who has the latest and best 
          copy of the "South Park" movie or any other downloadable flavor of the 
          moment. Eventually some of these files make their way to Web sites, 
          although that makes the distribution easier to trace, so the links 
          don't generally last too long. 
          <P>What brought online pirate films to wider attention was a digital 
          bootleg of George Lucas's "Phantom Menace" that began circulating soon 
          after the film's theatrical release. 
          <P>A lawyer from Lucasfilm sent cease-and-desist e-mail letters to 
          several suspected pirates.

                <P>Pirated copies of films are harder to make than pirated music 
                files. And because of their large size, they are harder to 
                download from the Internet. But the arrival of faster Internet 
                connections could increase the traffic in illegal film copies. 
                <P><IMG src="OPFMTF_files/29pira.a.gif"> <BR>•&nbsp; The film is 
                copied by smuggling video cameras into theaters or illegally 
                obtaining industry tapes. 
                <P><IMG src="OPFMTF_files/29pira.b.jpg"> <BR>•&nbsp; The 
                duplicate is then converted by a computer into MPEG-1 files of 
                up to 600 megabytes, which are compressed and broken up into 
                smaller files of 15 to 20 megabytes and made available on the 
                Net. Some copies are also made on video disks called VCD’s. 
                <P><IMG src="OPFMTF_files/29pira.c.gif"> <BR>•&nbsp;The pirated 
                film can then be downloaded and played on any computer with MPEG 
                player software, although the downloading times can be very 
                long. VCD copies are also traded and sold through Web sites and

          that online piracy is not going to be allowed, and it will be 
          punished," Radley said. 
          <P>According to the co-founder of ISO News, <A name=hit0000></A>who 
          goes by the online name <B>Krazy8</B>, the e-mail from Lucasfilm 
          scared away some pirates and couriers. Those who still operate are 
          keeping a lower profile: access to their IRC channels and FTP servers 
          is by invitation only and requires passwords. 
          <P>But the publicity surrounding Lucasfilm's action also brought in a 
          horde of new people interested in downloading the film. "Since 
          Lucasfilm made such a stink about it, I would bet there is at least a 
          50 percent increase in the amount of people who are trying to and may 
          have downloaded a pirated version of 'The Phantom Menace,' " 
          <B>Krazy8</B> wrote in an e-mail interview. "He brought huge light 
          into something only a few knew about." 
          <P>The fact that most movie pirates are not making money from their 
          activities means little where copyright is concerned. Paul Goldstein, 
          a professor at Stanford University Law School who specializes in 
          copyright law, said that anyone guilty of copyright infringement could 
          face criminal charges as well as civil action. 
          <P>"We're talking about it being a felony," Professor Goldstein said, 
          adding that first offenses are punishable with up to five years in 
          jail and financial restitution. "You can imagine how something like 
          'The Phantom Menace' being distributed over the Internet can pose 
          huges losses to the distributor." 
          <P>The Motion Picture Association of America's Internet piracy 
          division has asked Internet service providers to shut down a handful 
          of pirates and is working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 
          take further action against others. Richard Taylor, vice president of 
          public affairs for the association, conceded that pirates would 
          eventually overcome any technological safeguards built into movies to 
          prevent pirating. But by pursuing the traders, he said, the 
          organization intends to "change forever the perception that piracy is 
          a low-risk and high-reward proposition." 
          <P>"I think those who would choose the illegal route would hopefully 
          think twice before doing so," Taylor continued, "because of our 
          attempts to find you and take every action at our disposal to 
          discourage you from continuing that activity." 
          <P>The viewer of "Austin Powers" mused that Hollywood would be better 
          off capitalizing on the success of pirated MPEG versions. After 
          watching that film, he loaded an MPEG of the new independent film "The 
          Blair Witch Project" from his hard drive. 
          <P>"I can't wait to go see it in the theater," he said after watching 
          a few scenes. 
          <P>The pirated version of "The Blair Witch Project" has generated a 
          tremendous buzz in trading circles. The viewer wondered whether the 
          filmmakers themselves put a copy online. "Do you really think this has 
          never happened?" he said. "Small-budget independent filmmakers 
          couldn't buy the hype that 'Blair Witch' has been enjoying from word 
          of mouth on the Internet. Is it out of the question for a studio to 
          'misplace' a reviewer copy and it magically appears as the copy floats 
          all around the VCD pirate scene? Makes you wonder." 
          <P>Mark Curcio, chief executive of Artisan Entertainment, which 
          distributed "The Blair Witch Project," said that while the company 
          marketed the film extensively on the Internet, it did not 
          intentionally leak a copy. He said that he suspected that the pirated 
          version was made from a screener copy that made its way around 
          Hollywood and that Artisan has sent out warnings to suspected 
          copyright infringers. 
          <P>But Curcio added that he could see the day, once encryption and 
          other protection is in place, when studios would use MPEG's to 
          transmit their products legally, much as the music industry has taken 
          to online music in answer to the challenge of MP3. Last April, Artisan 
          used streaming video to show its film "Pi" in a pay-per-view window 
          through Sightsound.com, a site that offers streaming music and 
          authorized movies. 
          <P>
          <P>"It was an interesting experiment," he said. "We didn't get a lot 
          of people buying it, but I think we learned a lot. The fact that the 
          technology is there to do it and the marketplace -- albeit from an 
          economic standpoint, still very, very small -- that, in the future, it 
          can certainly be a viable business." 
          <P>Taylor of the M.P.A.A. said that before Hollywood can effectively 
          use the Internet to distribute films, it must first educate its 
          audience. "We want people to realize that just because it's on the 
          Internet, it's not all right for people to steal."
