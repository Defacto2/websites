</B><P>This was extracted from an article in Gamespot.com, isn't it nice to know you do make a impact :)<br>
"Blizzard said that there was in fact a web site claiming that you could get all the cheats for Starcraft by sending in your CD key numbers.
What was really happening was that people had illegal copies of the game and were seeking CD key numbers to activate their illegal copy of the game.
Once these CD key numbers were obtained, the person who obtained the number adds it to the install of Starcraft and the copy becomes unique.
If the user who owns the legal copy attempts to go up to the web and play Starcraft against others, they'll notice that someone else has already taken control of the account.
Blizzard said that it has voided the CD key numbers affected and given the gamers who bought the title a new number so they could play on Battle.net.".<br>

</B><P>The biggest most overhyped game in recent years would make a perfect target for an Aprils fools joke. But fortunatly for all you Blizzard fans the long wait is over. Just a few hours ago Razor 1911 showed the scene who really has the best cracker with the release of Starcraft. At a respectable 52 disks this was an excellent job by Beowulf.<br>
