It maybe beating a dead horse, but what the hey it fills space. If you remember about three weeks ago Krypto was very doubtful that Reality Check Network would be returning and claimed if it did return he would never rejoin. Well he has already contracted a famous scene coder to start work on a new Windows 95 interface for the magazine. The coder won't start until he has told by Krypto to begin.

After two plus months of idling <a href="http://www.scenelink.org">Scenelink</a> has returned with a new look (again). This time around they have replaced the monthly features section with an articles area and added the famed Dupelink.

Just incase you where wondering about those rumours of a PWA NFO being slipped onto a gold master of Windows98 before it went to press. Well they are completely false, as is the so-called modified code. There was also a webpage quoting a press release from Microsoft, and if you read it properly you could easily tell it was a fake. It contained lines that would never be used in a press release, like the one below.<br>
"Remember, if you are approached by one of these ex-employees, and they offer you source code to one of the many fine Microsoft releases, you are not entitled to use this code by law. Not even PWA is entitled to its use. Please return it. Please."

Class has released the much awaited and very hyped Unreal by Epic. At the equilent of over 120 disks this release will not be counted but Class do state in their Nfo that anyone is free to release a 75disk version. So one can assume this is not possible.

You thought your Diamond Monster 2 12meg rocked? Well a new range of Voodoo2 cards from Obsidian will be hitting a store near you soon. What makes these Voodoo2 Obsidians so special?
Well for starters the top of the line model called to Obsidian2 x-24 supports SBSLI (Single Board Scan Line Interleaving) with dual chips on board. It has 24megs of memory and get this,
it has six Voodoo2 processors running in parallel. As for benchmarks, Quake 2's timedemo 1 at 1024*768 on a P2 333 ran at an amazing 84.4fps! Oh and lets not forget about the price, one
of these babies will cost around $700us.

<a href="http://www.game-over.net">Game Over Online Magazine</a> is now open for business. Read the previous days news for more information.
<p>
Well the biggest os release since Windows 95 is now upon us, PWA brings you Windows 98 Retail Full Install at 21*5meg disks.
Here is a note for people who require the other versiosn of Windows 98 from the PWA nfo.<br>
You need to download the CABS and the RETAIL SETUP and unzip/unrar
	everything into one directory.  The reason for this is that as soon
	as I get install keys, I can release RETAIL UPGRADE, OEM FULL and
	OEM UPGRADE versions and they will only take 4 meg each (the CAB zips
	are generic thruout all these versions, I can just package up the 
	differences in seperate zips to save everyone space and time).  You just
	unzip whichever one you want into the same directory as the generic
	CAB zips.

absorbed by Game Over.<br>
Please note the url is game-over.net not .com like I stated before.

Ionizer's The Game Review has been delayed and now has a returning date of June the 7th.
The Game Review happens to be the longest surviving scene publication and at one time was
voted best newletter/electronic magazine in the scene.
<p>
This Friday (Saturday morning GMT) should see the launch of a new gaming publication called the
Game Over Online Magazine. This new publication is a joint venture between The Reviewers Guild
and The Gamers Edge. Game Over will feature news items and features on both the warez scene and
the bigger stories in the gaming scene. Another big feature of the publication will be the
online gaming reviews which will be a lot shorter and more to the point compaired to professional online publications.<br>
There is no news yet on what will happen to TRG and TGE, but if you want to be the first to visit
this new project goto www.game-over.net.

</B><P>Well if you have read Scenelink recently you would have discovered that Trix recently
spoke to Rebel Chicken on the topic of RCN returning. Trix claims they have plans
for it to return yet again during this summer. But what I am asking is, do we need RCN in 1998? Well
I think we don't need RCN. Who wants to read tabloid trash talking about things that happened many weeks
ago, a taboid that admitted proding events so they could continue the story for another issue?
Well the days of the scene news being controlled by a biased, monopolised, one pointed view are over. We now have Scene Link,
The Crazed Asylum, The Warez Regulator and our selves to give you different prospectives on events.
I suppose where RCN could carve itself a nice niche in the scene (other then creating a mass
following of lamers) is covering in detailed major events. But we will just have to wait and see.
Now I will use a cheap RCN tactic and ask for their responce on my comments, if they do ever return :)
