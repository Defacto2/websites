Sodom's web page has had a change of address, they can now be found at www.sodom.org.

It's not often that personal wars go public but this one between Crazy and Phalycide is just one case. First read reply.txt then supply.txt before reading a reply by Crazy. It all speaks for itself, really.

Class has released ODDWORLD_BETA_TO_FINAL_PATCH-CLS. The only problem is that it doesn't upgrade Oddworld, it downgrades it from Oddworld v2 to Oddworld v1.6. Class claims that their patch is from the store final and that Paradigm deliberatly changed the version number to hide the fact it was a beta. Of cause Paradigm totally denies this saying that Class's 1.6 Compusa patch is actually a pre-release and the final will not be on sale till next month. So who do you believe?

Here is a little story for you, this guy from 2000ad tries to help out a newbie who owns the box to a potentially great new swedish site.
The 2000ad guy realizes the site could use some help so he helps out the box owner with some suggestions, a gig worth of uploads 
before finally buying some hardware for the box using his own money. The 2000ad guy's big mistake was when
he asked some people from Millennium to upload to the site. They agreed to the offer as long as they received siteop access. The next thing the 2000ad guy
knows is he has been banned from the site's channel and removed from the site with the site owner not willing doing anything.
When you read about stories like this it really makes you wonder.

Nothing much has happened in the past couple of days so I thought I'd just mention that Hybrid's web page has
moved to http://www.hybrid.to. If you are wondering what the .to stands for it's Tonga a small island country in the
Pacific Ocean.

Today Class releases Fallout_Monster_Death_Animation_CRC_Working-CLS. Im going to ask what the hell is this crap?
<p>
iD software releases Quake II "compatibility test" the first playable code to Quake II. I think iD released this
after the beta code of the original Quake was released onto the internet and spread around like wild fire. Where
is Reflux when you need them to release it has a socalled final?

<b>Sunday 19th October</b>

Defacto 2 and Sodom launch a new scene news report called The Scene News. This new service that will tell readers
about the important happenings in the scene in a brief and easy to read format. The two current editors are Sensi
and IPggi.
<p>
It seems both Cypher and Ice have left Backlash for Razor 1911. But rumours have been spreading that the two left
Backlast due financial incentives offered by Razor. No one knows weather this is true or not but it is not leaving
a good taste in Backlash's mouth.
<p>
Reliance has disbanded after some internal problems and a lack of time and dedication on Phalycide's part.
<p>
Class bends the rules once more by releasing Fallout (Interplay) at 74disks, the only problem is it has no sound.
So look out for the Class Fallout SFX addon and a nuked introduction video.
<p>
It seems Endeavour of the ex-Razor fame has started up a new utility group with the unoriginal name of Paradox.
The name Paradox belongs to the famous Amiga group that was run by MAX. It seems that Endeavour doesn't know
or maybe even doesn't care about this important fact. Stealing group names from other scenes is one thing but
when you steal a name that belongs to a legand you can only tarnish it's glorious status with your pitiful attempt
at capturing a piece of it's history.
