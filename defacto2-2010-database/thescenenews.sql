As a result, the official government response has been to bust and lock up warez traders one-by-one. Basically, the government is fighting a war of attrition. The consequence is that about 120 United States warez traders have been convicted or pleaded guilty, with a few more internationally.\n</i><p></p><i>\nBut wars of attrition are costly. The government incurs significant enforcement costs, the traders prosecuted incur significant personal costs (possibly beyond the culpability of their behavior), and other people may be chilled from socially-beneficial non-infringing copying by the fear of being busted next.\n</i><p></p><i>\nWorse, I think the war of attrition is ultimately unwinnable. I think that, so long as digital assets are scarce and risky, there will continue to be people who will be attracted to the trading of such assets--even if we successfully busted every single warez trader currently in the scene.</i>', NULL, '2006-05-10 00:00:00', '1899-12-30 06:08:56', 'Ipggi', 'Eric Goldman', 'http://blog.ericgoldman.org/', 0, 0, '2006-05-10 06:08:56', 1130, 0),

Beyond that, authorities said they have taken at least eight additional steps to combat these crimes, which include the counterfeit trading and online piracy of movies, music and video games.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe most immediate and fundamental goal was increasing the number of prosecutors specifically assigned to Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property teams in various cities.

Yes we have finally given the site a much needed face lift. While cosmetically it is not all that different, underneath at the code level, everything has been rewritten from scratch. We basically converted what was a massive collection of various dynamic web pages and compiled them into web based applications.\n<p></p>\nThis means that in the future it will be a lot easier for us to add new features as well as to troubleshoot any bugs. The update also gave us a chance to redesign a number of the features, to hopefully make the site easier to use and faster. Of note is the crack-intro section and the on-line NFO browser, both redone. The group repository also now allows file filtering and sorts the groups in a more logical way.\n<p></p>\nWe have also made the site XHTML 1.1 compliant, this means that under modern browsers there should be no random HTML quirks and the like. But to implement this code we had to drop legacy support for the older browsers. We have not tested the site with anything earlier then Internet Explorer 6 and to be honest we can''t imagine it working too well. Though at least the removal of the legacy HTML code speeds up the browsing a bit.\n<p></p>\nIf you are curious, we have tested the site in Internet Explorer 6, Opera 9 and Firefox 1.5. While the site works fine in Internet Explorer 6 it does take longer to render, so if you haven''t considered updating maybe now is the time?\n<p></p>\nHopefully you will all enjoy the new update to the site, and if you run into any problems, bugs (on supported browsers) or errors please let us know. Now that this code update is complete we can go back to updating the content and files of this site. Sorry to everyone who has submitted files and updates that remain unprocessed, we will implement them in the next few weeks.', NULL, '2006-07-22 00:00:00', '1899-12-30 07:06:12', 'Ipggi', 'Defacto2', 'http://www.defacto2.net', -1, 0, '2006-07-22 07:06:12', 714, 0),

While we do scan every file we put online, we do not often run periodic update scans on the files already on the server.</p>\r\n<p>So we as always recommend that with any file you download from Defacto2. If it contains an execute or program file you should run with caution.
