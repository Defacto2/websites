The Sysop Association Network</span> was a collection of boards that used to originally share releases and later communicate using a message network relay.
Some called it the pirate equivalent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidonet">FidoNet</a>.

This was a group of BBS sysops that decided to form a ``network'' in order to increase communication and cooperation. While originally designed just to facilitate communication amongst sysops, a number of dedicated hacking boards as well as some pirate boards were members of TSAN. TSAN also featured ``echoed'' conferences, which were discussion groups that included messages from remote sites (i.e., a baby USENET with large message propagation delays), and these conferences included both hacking and pirating areas.
