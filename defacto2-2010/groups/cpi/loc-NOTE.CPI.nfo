    As some have commented not all software which includes a cracking
    groups title screen is actually cracked, but all the same the 
    cracking group is as well a distributer.  And as we see more and
    more software companies not protecting their software, we will not
    see the diminish of cracking groups for they act as a distribution
    channel as well................................Just a thought, CPI



Thanks to Mad Max for this new ware!
