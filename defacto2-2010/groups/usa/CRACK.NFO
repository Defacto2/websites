Run INSTALL.EXE to install the game, it will create a directory called NCAA
and unharc compressed files in there.  After installing, replace the NCAA.EXE
with the cracked NCAA.EXE found in this fix.  Just unzip and overwrite it.

Cracking note: Doc check thing, it will boot you back to DOS if you answer it
               incorrectly. Not much challenge but better than HyperSpeed!
