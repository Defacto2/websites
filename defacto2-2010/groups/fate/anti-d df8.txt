 ³   Defacto :  Recently Fate Decided to change the name of the well          ³
 ³              known and EXTREMLY popular #Fatefiles to something new        ³
 ³              and something that did not even hint Fate in the name.        ³
 ³              Can you tell us some of the reasons behind this change?       ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³    Anti-D :  There are 2 reasons:                                          ³
 ³               1) fATE needed to disassociate itself with it's humongus     ³
 ³                  offer channel's name. We had everyone employed at         ³
 ³                  the SPA in the channel just laughing it up and            ³
 ³                  kicking our couriers. Sending emails to their root's      ³
 ³                  and so on. Lots of attention we didn't need.              ³
 ³               2) It was fun, it was neat, but it was time we released      ³
 ³                  it from our control. We were spending way too much        ³
 ³                  time constantly trying to regain control of #fatefiles    ³
 ³                  from lame "irc takeover groups" that made #ff their       ³
 ³                  #1 target. A sort of breaking into fort knox on irc.      ³
 ³                  So it is now run by another group, we still have some     ³
 ³                  policy decisions and bot access though. It's a huge       ³
 ³                  stress release                                            ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³   Defacto :  People have rumored and gossiped about the different          ³
 ³              reasons that Fate has received such a bad name. The           ³
 ³              main reason that people associate this with is Fatefiles      ³
 ³              and Fates dedication to IRC couriering. Something that a      ³
 ³              lot of people think is a waste of time. How do you            ³
 ³              comment on that?                                              ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³    Anti-D :  hmm, I would hardly say we have a "dedication" to irc         ³
 ³              couriering. We've always once on the net had our sites        ³
 ³              at the core. Infact we did little if any irc courier at       ³
 ³              first. If of our couriers curry on irc, it was by their       ³
 ³              own choice. We don't really care either way about it as       ³
 ³              long as it doesn't interfere with their ftp assignments.      ³
 ³              As for our bad name, people just do it because they get       ³
 ³              into a habit. There are a lot of elitists in the scene.       ³
 ³              I don't know why people rag on us, and I don't really         ³
 ³              care. I, nor does the rest of my crew need to hear from       ³
 ³              anyone that our group sucks. We are very happy, and we        ³
 ³              know we are doing great and getting better.                   ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³   Defacto :  So your saying #ff wasn't even a necessity of fate            ³
 ³              couriers, it was something that fate couriers did on          ³
 ³              their own ambition?                                           ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³    Anti-D :  Well, not exactly. #ff was started and operated by us,        ³
 ³              officially, from the council, not by the couriers, but it     ³
 ³              was not part of our jobs list. It was sort of a side thing    ³
 ³              and since we were the first to do it, it became huge.         ³
 ³              Eventually it manifested into a monster, as you know if       ³
 ³              you join the chan :)                                          ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³   Defacto :  Recently (2-3) months or so ago I guess.. Mikeysoft           ³
 ³              Joined Fate as a Senior. Can you tell us about the            ³
 ³              groups decision to invite him in and what exactly             ³
 ³              happened in the SHORT period of time he was with the          ³
 ³              group.                                                        ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³    Anti-D :  We invited him in because he was qualified and had            ³
 ³              specifically lended us a hand in a very trying time for       ³
 ³              the group. Mikey is, no doubt, incredibly smart and           ³
 ³              seasoned for the scene, and in business in general.           ³
 ³              Mikey actually did not do a whole lot. He was coined          ³
 ³              Public Relations Manager, but with his various IRC            ³
 ³              adventures and millions of other jobs he was doing, he        ³
 ³              didn't have much time for fATE, which left him just           ³
 ³              hanging out a lot, but that was ok. He was there when we      ³
 ³              needed him, and when he came he always brought a lot to       ³
 ³              the table.                                                    ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³   Defacto :  So why was he allowed membership in fate if he didn't do      ³
 ³              a lot? Was it because fate was insuring more channel          ³
 ³              security with him being an irc operator?                      ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³    Anti-D :  Not at all. Mikey had always helped us with #ff a good bit    ³
 ³              before he was in the group, and he was always willing to      ³
 ³              help. His allowance into the group was not relevant to        ³
 ³              his o-lines. Infact he has saved #ff2 (I'll call it :) )      ³
 ³              a couple times since out of fATE. He was allowed              ³
 ³              membership because of experience, contacts, maturity,         ³
 ³              wit, and common sense. Things found very rare on the net      ³
 ³              and in the scene in general. I leap at the chance to          ³
 ³              find a senior member with those qualities. Besides, like      ³
 ³              I said, Mikey was there when needed for the most part, we     ³
 ³              just sorta let it slide. Mikey was definitely a unique        ³
 ³              situation though. I don't want to give the impression         ³
 ³              that our seniors are allowed to slack because it is quite     ³
 ³              the opposite.                                                 ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³   Defacto :  Fate is such a large group but really has not made a name     ³
 ³              for Itself on some of the bigger sites such as LA, BBX,       ³
 ³              CRC and some others. Is Fate not trying to become the         ³
 ³              best or are you as some people say "A Courierngr group        ³
 ³              for the masses"?                                              ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³    Anti-D :  Neither. I don't define the best by other peoples sites.      ³
 ³              We just started getting some presence on LA, BBX and CRC,     ³
 ³              btw- BBX, started as a fATE site and well, that's a whole     ³
 ³              other story. Anyway our sites are packed and fast. Our        ³
 ³              main site is comparable to CRC or LA. Maybe we may miss       ³
 ³              a release by 5-20 mins, what group doesn't. All groups        ³
 ³              get some things faster as you know, mostly dependent on       ³
 ³              their "official releasers". We are the best group for         ³
 ³              everyone in our group and always will be. fATE is a tight     ³
 ³              crowd and we've come a long long way, we haven't lived so     ³
 ³              long and watched others come and go by luck, without          ³
 ³              getting too "disneyish" there is a bit of a magic to fATE,    ³
 ³              a difference between it and other groups in the scene.        ³
 ³              That's what we pride ourselves on more then presence on       ³
 ³              LA.                                                           ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³   Defacto :  Fate, to me, does not seem to be wanting to improve its       ³
 ³              image. A groups moral presence in itself, I agree, is a       ³
 ³              good thing to have higher than that of what other people      ³
 ³              think of you. But I have noticed almost anytime somebody      ³
 ³              from Fate enters a channel and starts talking about Fate      ³
 ³              they are blasted almost immediately for even mentioning       ³
 ³              the name. This is something to me that would atleast start    ³
 ³              to nerve me a bit. Do you feel that this is something that    ³
 ³              maybe the Seniors in fate should be working on improving      ³
 ³              (By getting better on LA, BBX, etc.) to improve your          ³
 ³              image to help your couriers out there in irc/Judgment.        ³
 ³              If not for their respect that they deserve?                   ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³    Anti-D :  Well, not exactly, if you've been in the scene, you know      ³
 ³              that the majority of ppl in it are, well, childish.           ³
 ³              Anybody who says that fATE is lame is saying because          ³
 ³              they don't know us, because I've been in a lot of groups:     ³
 ³              TDU-JAM, RiSC for a short while, DoD, quite a few years.      ³
 ³              I know what lame is, and know what not if you call fATE       ³
 ³              lame, then you, yourself are a liar, because you don't        ³
 ³              know anything about fATE and I know this, and the seniors     ³
 ³              know this, but yes, it is very disheartening when a new       ³
 ³              courier might have to deal with this. It would be nice to     ³
 ³              be on more sites of the "big l33t sites", but we are just     ³
 ³              concerned about it fATE is on a different level (not          ³
 ³              higher or lower) but a different idea I assure you.           ³
 ³              Anyone on a fATE site has all the warez damn near as fast     ³
 ³              as LA or CRC or whatever. That's what matters.                ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³   Defacto :  Some other groups in the past have changed  their name as     ³
 ³              a move to "start with a clean slate," has fate considered     ³
 ³              this to escape its reputation?                                ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³    Anti-D :  Yes; And we have unanimously decide not to. We don't need     ³
 ³              to cower behind a new name. I have never been more proud      ³
 ³              in my life period, and I know many of the council /           ³
 ³              seniors / members feel the same. I wouldn't change the        ³
 ³              name if there was guarantee to be #1 by a landslide.          ³
 ³              Groups that are willing to change their name just to be       ³
 ³              popular with the other kids on the playground are the         ³
 ³              same groups that come and go. fATE/RiSC remain.               ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³   Defacto :  Okay well thank you for your time. Is there anything else     ³
 ³              you would like to say before we end?                          ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³    Anti-D :  I see a LOT of new groups talk about in there nfo's,          ³
 ³              "If you want maturity and a solid professional group          ³
 ³              with no fooling around come to <insert group here>" all       ³
 ³              the time, and they talk about how they are so experienced     ³
 ³              and blah blah, and you find out it's a hyper 12 year old      ³
