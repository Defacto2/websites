Release notes


  This is a preaty good GAME as educational software goes.  Nice VGA and
SoundBlaster support.  It didn't have any type of protection, but the install
program that comes with it would only install from drives A: or B:.  There
were hidden files on both disks, but these files were used only be the install
program.  I have written a new INSTALL.BAT file that will install CAE in at
directory of any drive.  I suggest using it instead, but if you want to
recreate the original disks, just unzip to floppies and RENAME the install
program back to INSTALL.EXE (no you don't need to rehide the files)
