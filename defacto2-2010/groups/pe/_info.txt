Don't know much about this group, but what I know from it,
         is that they were really enemies with all other cracking groups!
         Now quite dead. I remember a fight on some boards and nets
         between PE and another group (cannot remember which one exactly)
         which both claimed to have released X-Wing first.
         (ps: claiming to be first in the release: one group uploaded
          the disks before the other except for one, and the other
          uploaded the entire set later. Who 'officially' released
          it first? We will never know).
