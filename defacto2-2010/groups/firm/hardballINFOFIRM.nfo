Hardball ][ - Accolade

Cracked by Lord Blix of The FiRM

Hello, gang.  Another exciting (?) game from Accolade with VERY good
AdLib support.  To set it up for your system, unZip into 1 directory on
a HD or onto 3 floppies and run SETUP.EXE from disk 1.

Everything seems to work.  I can't guarantee that the 7th inning stretch
may be a little longer than normal (anyone remember Hardball I?)
