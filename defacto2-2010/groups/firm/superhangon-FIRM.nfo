Super HangOn by Sega - Cracked by Lord Blix of The FiRM

Another exciting motorcycle racing game from the hallowed halls of Sega.
Looks like alot of fun if you're into this kind of thing.  Check out
all of the other fine FiRM releases from the last few days (Jeez, there's
been about 10 the last two days.  ALL WORKING... ALL SUPERIOR.
Only from the FiRM (and it fits on a 360k disk too..!)
