Dr. Detergent / TDT 1993


I herby  officially retire from  the scene.  Got an  excellent job which
takes me all over the world, so don't have time for this stuff any more.

To  all the sysops  worldwide, please delete my accounts on your boards.
If there  are any new  applications under  my name, you may rest assured
that it's not me.

It was great serving  the Elite underground.  Take care all ya boiz - my
friends, and maybe some enemies (don't remember having ny thou!)

All ya groups, keep up the good work ya do for the pirate scene - as you
know without you, there would be nothing.

This is a very short msg, compared to most of the docs I write, but it's
all that's needed.




Till sometime in the future.

Take care.




Dr. Detergent : VEC/GB/INT/PHX/INC/DW/UNT/THG/TDT.  1988 - 1993.
