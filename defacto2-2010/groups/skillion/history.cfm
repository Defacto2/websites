<span class="bold">Skillion</span> was a relatively unknown Amiga group who initially joined up with a fellow European group, <a href="groups.cfm?mode=detail&org=razor1911">Razor 1911</a> to co-release on the PC.
This was short lived however, and Skillion on the PC would not be seen again until a year later.
The group had a bit of success in 1993 but were never in the same league as the bigger PC groups.
