 ³ Chemist: The Renegade Chemist, I am a member of Prestige, sort of an       ³
 ³          organizer, part time supplier and really bad, bad cracker.        ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³ Defacto: Chemist can you tell us a little about how you first got          ³
 ³          introduced into the scene and what got you started with Warez?    ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³ Chemist: Okay.  Well when I started calling out, it was on a friend's      ³
 ³          borrowed 1200 baud modem. I was calling out on my true-blue       ³
 ³          IBM 8086 PC with 568k and a pair of full-height 360k drives.      ³
 ³          The case I think must have been made of titanium, anyway that     ³
 ³          case would certainly survive a nuclear blast. The first boards    ³
 ³          we called were the public domain porno boards, and when I saw     ³
 ³          that I was like in wanker heaven.  You must remember, I was       ³
 ³          like 12 years old, and being able to snag pics of naked           ³
 ³          chicks in compromising positions meant a lot to me - I would      ³
 ³          no longer have to rifle my Dad's drawers and find his dirty       ³
 ³          mags. After a while that got boring, I discovered a shitty        ³
 ³          warez board and the rest was history .. For my birthday one       ³
 ³          year I got a 2400 baud modem of my very own, and  from there      ³
 ³          I continued to trade on all the local WWIV boards.  WWIV          ³
 ³          was the popular software then, and Telegard was pretty popular    ³
 ³          also. I remember the big board in 214 (Dallas area) at the time   ³
 ³          was DUNE, Freddy Krueger's board.  I was on his board but not     ³
 ³          for very long. Even when I was totally lame, I had a bad          ³
 ³          habit of telling people exactly what I thought, and Sysops        ³
 ³          don't like it when you tell them they're wrong a lot, and         ³
 ³          when you ask a lot of stupid questions. Then there was the fact   ³
 ³          that DUNE was like the port of entry for all the wares into       ³
 ³          Dallas, so I was never able to upload there, since I was just     ³
 ³          a local lamer. Even though I had GREAT uploads on all the         ³
 ³          local boards, just by shuttling stuff back and forth between      ³
 ³          all of them, I still couldn't get onto DUNE. Back then all the    ³
 ³          boards were 2400 baud.  9600 HST had just started, v.32 was       ³
 ³          around shortly after that but HST was still faster. HST's were    ³
 ³          really expensive, so I couldn't get one.  I was just a kid.       ³
 ³          Finally after months of trading on the local boards, I found a    ³
 ³          local board that ran HST, had a few LD callers, and would let     ³
 ³          me on. That was the first "real" board that I was on for an       ³
 ³          extended period of time. The board was called Oblivion, the       ³
 ³          Sysop named Agent Orange, and it ran a forum-hacked software      ³
 ³          called Utopia. That was one of the first forum boards that I      ³
 ³          called.  Certainly there were other forum hacks at that time,     ³
 ³          the most popular of which was Emulex/2, at least for a while.     ³
 ³          Anyway, I digress.  After a while the 214 scene seemed to get     ³
 ³          better, but I still couldn't get on DUNE.  So I started calling   ³
 ³          LD with my 2400 baud modem, and was able to slowly pull files     ³
 ³          in. Back in those days it was SOO easy to get codes .. I          ³
 ³          remember using 950-1044,1033,1022 and a bunch of other codes      ³
 ³          to get the wares into my AC.  But even though I was calling       ³
 ³          LD, DUNE was always faster and I still couldn't get on ..         ³
 ³          Eventually I got onto DUNE, but by then I was so enmeshed in      ³
 ³          the LD scene that it didn't matter.  I got involved in several    ³
 ³          small groups, the most successful of those being ICE (a really    ³
 ³          lame INC rip off), but never accomplished a whole lot until a     ³
 ³          little later. Anyway .. when I turned 16 I got a car and didn't   ³
 ³          do shit in the scene for a long time. After I totalled my car,    ³
 ³          I had a lot more free time and I started to get back into it.     ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³            This is about the time when I started to get involved with      ³
 ³          Razor 1911. When I was in junior high, I knew a guy named         ³
 ³          Brian.  Brian was a friend of a friend and we didn't get along    ³
 ³          all that much, I was real lame and remember thinking he was       ³
 ³          super 'leet because he was a big name in an Amiga group,          ³
 ³          Razor 1911. Anyway, Brian moved to Virginia and I thought that    ³
 ³          was the last I'd hear of him.  I went about my business in        ³
 ³          214, running my 2400 baud LSD board, The Crime Lab, getting       ³
 ³          all the files really fast from my friends who ran boards          ³
 ³          with HST's and Duals, and using my local courier group LEECH      ³
 ³          (locals exchanging everything caught from HST's) to control 214's ³
 ³          2400 baud boards.  There were a lot of them back then.            ³
 ³          INC had the city in a stranglehold, they were dominating and      ³
 ³          Cool Hand decided to keep the city dry of wares.  Back then there ³
 ³          was no Internet, and all the boards in 214 relied on the big      ³
 ³          INC boards (Midnite Oil I, II and III) to bring in the wares,     ³
 ³          so if Cool Hand wanted 214 dry, it stayed that way.               ³
 ³          Only a few of my friends had the balls to let me leech from       ³
 ³          them at night and spread the wares across the city with my        ³
 ³          courier group, LEECH. Eventually LEECH even had suppliers, we     ³
 ³          formed a group called CWF (Consolidated Wares Force) and put      ³
 ³          out some utils and games and stuff.  Well, one day I was at a     ³
 ³          friend's house, copying some new stuff and I saw a release from   ³
 ³          none other than Razor 1911.  I was immediately stunned and        ³
 ³          surprised, and I checked out the nfo file, and discovered that    ³
 ³          this was indeed the same Razor 1911 as my friend Brian had been   ³
 ³          in before. In fact, Brian was still in it .. in case you          ³
 ³          haven't figured it out yet, Brian was Zodact Stratux, the         ³
 ³          leader of Razor 1911 in the US. Later he dropped the              ³
 ³          Stratux, but anyway, it was Zodact. Back then you could find      ³
 ³          phone numbers to boards in NFO files, and I called one of         ³
 ³          their HQ's, Apocalypse, and left a message with my phone          ³
 ³          number for Brian. Brian called me, we talked, he kind of made     ³
 ³          fun of me and that was the end of that. But I was persistent..    ³
 ³          I hooked up Razor with some of my friends so that they could      ³
 ³          help him release, and Razor put out a few games from              ³
 ³          a friend that worked at babbage's. But then out of the blue,      ³
 ³          Razor 1911 shut down and some of the members joined INC.          ³
 ³          They did it because Razor had gotten really big, and there were   ³
 ³          a lot of people who claimed to be part of Razor, and in name      ³
 ³          WERE part of Razor, but guys that didn't do shit but took         ³
 ³          credit were ruining it for Zodact and the rest.  I got ahold      ³
 ³          of Brian and begged him to reconsider, and after a couple of      ³
 ³          weeks the Razor crew left INC and that was when I became a        ³
 ³          member. I had a lot of time on my hands and I was really          ³
 ³          motivated.  Zodact told me the ropes, I bought game magazines,    ³
 ³          checked companies, did everything I could think of to find        ³
 ³          out when games were coming out. We still got beat consistently    ³
 ³          by USA/Fairlight and INC, but now I knew what they were going     ³
 ³          to release when they put it out.  Zodact had an account at        ³
 ³          the fast software distributor at the time and ordered stuff       ³
 ³          from there, but USA went one better - they arranged to have       ³
 ³          people PICK UP at the distributor, so we weren't fast enough      ³
 ³          most of the time, and even when we were, we could be certain      ³
 ³          that USA, INC, THG and anyone else would have the game at         ³
 ³          the same time as us.                                              ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³             So it was a bitch.  We lost on a lot of stuff, and we          ³
 ³          duped on a lot of stuff, unknowingly, but a dupe's a dupe.        ³
 ³          Razor's reputation started to sink, because we just couldn't get  ³
 ³          enough games to compete, and a lot of the games we did get were   ³
 ³          released by someone else first.  To make matters worse, the       ³
 ³          only money we had was the money we spent ourselves, and from a    ³
 ³          few small dist sites.  And on top of all that, Zodact was         ³
 ³          losing interest in the scene, but that was probably a good        ³
 ³          thing as it forced me to take more control of the group, and      ³
 ³          to see how shit would be run.  Anyway, in Jan/Feb of 1992,        ³
 ³          the USA/Fairlight bust came (The NotSoHumbleBabe and              ³
 ³          The Grim Reaper got busted for carding) and the scene like        ³
 ³          totally shut down for a while.  I still have a pretty             ³
 ³          funny "TRC retires" letter from that time, actually.              ³
 ³          I swore that I would not be involved in the scene anymore,        ³
 ³          and it probably would have been better had I not gotten           ³
 ³          involved - god knows the scene is a distraction from hell.        ³
 ³          But I had just gotten a brand new 14.4k USR Dual for Christmas    ³
 ³          via the Sysop deal, and I didn't want it to go to waste..         ³
 ³          I knew that Star Trek : 25th Anniversary would be coming out      ³
 ³          soon from Interplay, and I knew that I'd be able to get it, so    ³
 ³          I did.  I decided that would be the only game I'd ever get for    ³
 ³          Razor. But once I got it, and won on it (even though I later      ³
 ³          found out that uSA had released it also, and possibly even beat   ³
 ³          me to it) I was hooked .. I started to keep better track of       ³
 ³          the games coming out, and with Zodact gradually falling out of    ³
 ³          it I found people who could work with me in the group.            ³
 ³          Guys like The Witch King, who lived on the east coast, had        ³
 ³          tax id's with which I could set up distributor accounts, and      ³
 ³          had a credit card he'd give me so that I could call companies     ³
 ³          and order stuff to him ..  People like The Hawk and Butcher,      ³
 ³          who helped the group immeasurably..  Anyway after that one        ³
 ³          release, I was hooked and the group started to  grow.             ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³            We were in close competition with INC for a long, long          ³
 ³          time .. then towards the end of may '92 INC pretty much went      ³
 ³          belly up and our main competitor emerged as FLT PC, headed        ³
 ³          by The Grim Reaper. Grimmy came back from being busted with       ³
 ³          The NotSoHumbleBabe's much-vaunted supply list, and really        ³
 ³          put out a LOT of shit while I was in Germany for 6 weeks.         ³
 ³          Some of my favorite releases from back then included Links        ³
 ³          386 Pro, Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe : P-160 Expansion,       ³
 ³          and a few others. All of them had significance for me ..          ³
 ³          Luftwaffe was the first time my group beat INC in a race,         ³
 ³          and Links 386 was the biggest game I had put out up until then .. ³
 ³          Anyway late '92 I found Randall Flagg.  He was cracking for an    ³
 ³          Italian group, Dead Memory, and when I saw him do a crack for a   ³
 ³          LucasArts game I knew I had to have him. By now I had kind of     ³
 ³          figured out how to run a group, and formed my initial             ³
 ³          philosophy ..  Cracking is most important, respectable boards     ³
 ³          are 2nd in importance, and supply is 3rd most important.          ³
 ³          Razor 1911 thrived for a long time under my leadership, but       ³
 ³          it was always because of our core .. we had the strongest,        ³
 ³          most dominant cracking core out of ANY group for at least 2       ³
 ³          straight years. And for a lot of that time we had incredible      ³
 ³          spreading, headed by guys like Razor Blade, Hoppermania           ³
 ³          (before he turned into a cardwhore), and DEViL ..                 ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³            I moved to Austin in late '92, and from '92-'94 we totally      ³
 ³          rocked. During this time members like Marauder, Excessive Knight, ³
 ³          Butcher, and others made their mark on the group. In fact most    ³
 ³          of those guys joined in late '92 / early '93 and were in for      ³
 ³          the duration. Then in '93 sometime, an upstart courier with a     ³
 ³          bad attitude named Lord Thinker quit the group and started        ³
 ³          PE along with some older guys, like The Hawk.  They were tough    ³
 ³          for a while because they were picking up at the same distributor  ³
 ³          where USA had picked up before, and I still wasn't able to get    ³
 ³          a reliable pickup contact out there. '93 was probably the most    ³
 ³          fun I had in Razor, that was when we warred with groups like PE,  ³
 ³          Pentagram, TDT, and others.  It was a good time.                  ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³            In '94 the conflict was mostly between us and PTG, then I       ³
 ³          lost my phone line, and in my absence the Legend split occurred,  ³
 ³          where a bunch of Razor members, headed by Butcher and Westbam,    ³
 ³          formed a new group with former TRSI (and current Prestige)        ³
 ³          members Tazman, Troops, Troll and others.  When I came back to    ³
 ³          the scene in August of '94, I got in touch with what was left of  ³
 ³          the group (which wasn't much), Lord Thinker and I became friends, ³
 ³          and Razor was re-born with Zeus leading the way as the king of    ³
 ³          supply.                                                           ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³ Defacto: Chemist, can you tell us some of your SPEFIC reasons for          ³
 ³          deciding to Leave Razor in 1995?                                  ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³ Chemist:   I didn't leave Razor until 1996, and depending on who you       ³
 ³          talked to I may even have been kicked out.  Ultimately, it        ³
 ³          doesn't really matter because if I hadn't quit I would have       ³
 ³          been kicked out. In October of '95, I realized that Razor was     ³
 ³          pretty close to its peak (which we hit in November of '95).       ³
 ³          The floppy scene was dying out, I would be working full time and  ³
 ³          going to school full time starting in Spring, Zeus would be in    ³
 ³          school in Spring, Lord Thinker in school in Spring, you get the   ³
 ³          picture. Zeus, Lord Thinker, myself, Marauder, and                ³
 ³          Randall Flagg agreed that the best thing to do would be to        ³
 ³          shut the group down at the end of January '95. Anyway, the 5 of   ³
 ³          us agreed that since we were in charge of the situation, we'd     ³
 ³          shut her down at the beginning of '95. Our WHQ of old, Mirage,    ³
 ³          had already gone down, and there weren't too many of us           ³
 ³          old-timers left.  Zeus and I were good friends even then,         ³
 ³          but the fun would only last so long with the companies going CD   ³
 ³          only (at that time we didn't foresee the advent of the CD scene   ³
 ³          as it is today) ..  Anyway, one day I saw a few releases from     ³
 ³          Nexus, The GEcko's old group.  NXS wasn't doing a whole lot,      ³
 ³          and I figured the titles that GEcko could get now and then        ³
 ³          would add to the pile for us, and by themselves wouldn't do       ³
 ³          much for NXS so I asked him to join. We chatted on the            ³
 ³          Razor WHQ, TAG, for 5 minutes and then he offered to join,        ³
 ³          bringing pay sites and a UK supplier, Hot Tuna, with him, as      ³
 ³          well as a great cracker named Beowulf.  I said great, but         ³
 ³          that I didn't want SPeed Racer in the group, as I thought he      ³
 ³          was just GEcko's store pickup lackey, and even then I'd seen      ³
 ³          him fuck up almost every release that came his way. Quite         ³
 ³          honestly, I thought that TSR was a total idiot, and I didn't      ³
 ³          want dead weight in the group.  But GEcko insisted, so I said     ³
 ³          cool, he can come in. When GEcko joined, he agreed that the       ³
 ³          group would be shut down in early '95, as he would not have       ³
 ³          time for it anymore then either. Eos joined shortly afterward,    ³
 ³          and he agreed to the shutdown as well. My mistake at the time     ³
 ³          was not talking to TSR.  GEcko didn't make it clear to me that    ³
 ³          he and TSR were a team, and that TSR made a lot of decisions      ³
 ³          in NXS.  If I had talked to TSR then, he would have had to        ³
 ³          swear to the shutdown as well, but since I didn't, I guess he     ³
 ³          didn't feel beholden to it. Well, we kicked ass until December,   ³
 ³          when someone turned in Zeus. Zeus stopped supplying, and in       ³
 ³          January, when we were supposed to be shutting down, TSR           ³
 ³          started putting out budget releases and talking about the         ³
 ³          resurgence of Razor in the nfo files.  He also started            ³
 ³          calling dist sites, telling them to send him money, and even      ³
 ³          increased their monthly contribution .. To make a long story      ³
 ³          short, I went apeshit.  The prime reason that we had decided      ³
 ³          to disband at the END of January, and not at the beginning,       ³
 ³          is because some of our paysites had paid through the end of       ³
 ³          Jan. and we didn't want to fuck them over. When TSR started       ³
 ³          asking for more money, it was apparent that he was trying to      ³
 ³          pull a fast one - or so I thought.  It looked like he was         ³
 ³          trying to get cash out of these guys and bail. Well, to make a    ³
 ³          long story short, Eos/Gecko didn't keep their word, TSR did       ³
 ³          some shifty underhanded shit, and when I got back from Mardi      ³
 ³          Gras in February my account on TAG was gone.  I got it back,      ³
 ³          quit the group, and all the old timers left with me. That was     ³
 ³          when Razor 1911 ceased to be what it once was.  If you            ³
 ³          look in the nfo now, theres not one person that was in there      ³
 ³          before, except Sector9, but he's just in there because he         ³
 ³          wants to be in a group that's been around 10 years.  S9 was one   ³
 ³          of the original founders, but didn't do anything for the last     ³
 ³          1 1/2 years that I was in the group.                              ³
 ³                                                                            ³
 ³            And as far as being sad about leaving the group. Yeah, at       ³
 ³          first I was disappointed about it, and pretty angry, but          ³
 ³          eventually I got used to it. You see, the whole reason I          ³
 ³          wanted to shut down Razor was because I didn't want it to         ³
 ³          turn lame.                                                        ³
 ³                                       To Be Continued.. .. .               ³
