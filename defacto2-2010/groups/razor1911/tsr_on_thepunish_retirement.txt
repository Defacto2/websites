First off I remember The Punishers' old glory days when he supplied his 
first game Quake! At the time he was doing a lot of coordination, recruiting 
and organizing things in the group, he was responsible, ambitious, quick 
study, and definitely glory bound but most of all he would be the perfect 
one to pass the torch after my 2 years time. 

Sure enough if anyone had any doubts about the group when I handed it to him, 
it would soon pass as he pulled in a variety of some of the best suppliers 
and crackers this scene has ever seen. His supplying prowess grew with an 
intensity that would strike fear in any opposing group that had the 
misfortune of competing against RAZOR, but best of all as a leader he was 
motivational,  inspirational and he led by example. 

Truly a man of honor, loyalty, and one who put the family first and foremost. 
As all good things must pass it will be a sad loss to the group his 
resignation, but we wish him luck in his new career endeavors. As far as the 
future of this group goes, it has survived throughout time and no doubt that 
this group will continue to produce quality games in the future as we see 
Pitbull, a familiar face now carrying the torch as I wish him luck in his 
new job !
