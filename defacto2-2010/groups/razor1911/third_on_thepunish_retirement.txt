I basically want to say how much I respect The Punisher for the job he
done for "The Family". His hard work and loyalty to Razor 1911 will be
something that I will always remember him for. What an asset he has been
and he will be missed by all of us. His reign is something he should be
very proud of !  He has sacrificed his personal life to help keep the
history of Razor 1911 going on as the finest and oldest game group EVER.
His style and grace :) was one like I have never seen. Thanks again for
a job well done ! I hope you can stay around to offer support and
advice. I have faith that Pitbull will continue on with the tradition of
Razor 1911 and will be a fine leader. TP, good luck old friend!
