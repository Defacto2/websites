Please pass this on to Faith Healer and anyone else that thinks this:
1.) SLAIN was *NEVER* any kind of leader or organiser in Razor.
2.) I left purely because of personal reason (namely a full-time
    job and NOW a 20hours a week Course on top!).
3.) The Dogs (dont pass this bit on) i got WERE from Butcher, he just
    didnt want to deal with it himself. Now he is completely quit!
4.) The *ONLY* Person to leave Razor for Pentagram is Slain.
5.) The worlds C00L and PWA simply do not go together. So there is no
    way a 'C00l' supplier would even be interested. PWA is the only
    group this year to release more megs of DUPE shit than NEXUS!
    (sorry for ragginh but this is FACT!).
6.) For Faith Healer to spread this type of bullshit, i just lost
    ANY respect i ever had for him.
