                 -- InfoFile on Operation Wolf --   CHiNA
 
 
As most of you have now heard this wonderful long awaited game suddenly
was released, but not by Taito, FiRM, PTL or MCM, but by a guy named General
Zaroff.
 
If you downloaded this 'game' somewhere then you probably noticed that it
said it was cracked by PTL.  How can PTL crack a game when it hasn't even
been released out on the market, according to The Viper he called Taito and
they told him that it wouldn't be released until the third week of July.
 
Therefore this guy obviously did this to frame PTL (against FiRM) 
 
General Zarhoff (also known as The Gipper) did this Sunday I do believe and was
stupid enough to put it up on his own board (where several people downloaded
it) and then proceded to upload it to The House of Phreaks and you know how it
goes it was easily distibuted around.
 
This guy can be found around a few boards but you can pay him a personal
visit on the board he runs Crystal Chasm (408) 997-9107 CASJO.  I didn't
think it would be neccesary to post his Voice #, Address and Real Name.
 
o What the file does o
 
When you first run the program it will tell you that it is PTL.  Next
it will ask you for your graphics mode and sound ability.  After that it
will clear the screen, delete Config.Sys  Command.Com  Autoexec.Bat
IBMBIO.Com  IBMCOM.Com and then it will lock up.
 
The files are Wolf.001  Wolf.Exe  Runme.Bat  Title.Ptl    The rest of
the files on disk one are useless garbage and on Disk 2 the entire disk
    is all docs.
 
I hope this file helped to prevent the use of this program and make sure you
keep a look out for this guy because he is obviously wanted by PTL and FiRM.
