Hi, Gang! - In case you're wondering why I'm bothering to crack this one, you
have probably forgotten about the invisible files DEMAA.COM and DEMAB.COM that
are hidden in your C:\ Directory, probably put there by Indoor Sports or Ice
Hockey, or some other older Mindscape game.  The invisible files all work
interchangeably across games, so some of the Mindscape games you have that you
thought were unprotected aren't! - but enough bullshit.  This version does not
check for them, and should work on any DOS drive (no more Hard Disk only
limitation).  Enjoy!
