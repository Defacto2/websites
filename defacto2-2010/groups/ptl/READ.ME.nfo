11/01/89 - Pyschic War by Koydai

	Hi folks, I'm back after a long leave of abscene.  I was out of the
pirate world due to my HD breaking down.  A hearty thanks to Ranger Rick of 
Rock'in Ranch.  This program was supplied by Claude Rains.  Thanks to all
that have helped me out ... Type in anything or just hit return at the
doc check.  This is sometype of EGA space adventure game.  Looks Japanese
to me.

-Jenetic Bytemare

P.S. - The PTL Club has been restructed due to Jim jail sentence j/k but
seriously, we have merged with several other groups and formed TRIAD, we
are composed of members of The PTL Club, $PRINT, UGC, and other groups.
Also with our group, are members from the Emulex development team, Sam
Brown, etc.

Once I get more storage the Plutonium Mines will be back up again, if you
are interested in supplying our new group, please send mail to a TRIAD
member.  "Anyone want to sell a 330 meg drive cheap?" 

And finally, the greets: A hello to ...
