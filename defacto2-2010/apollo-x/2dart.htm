small tutorial on how to draw some cool stuff,using just your hand, <br>
the mouse,and a drawing program.It's called pixel drawing,that is because you <br>
draw the picture pixel by pixel,and use as few effects and tools as possible, <br>
use your imagination to make things look cool. <br>
<br>
The tutorial is done by me (biXen),and there will be new tutorials added to this <br>
page frequently,so please check back to look for more tutorials.I will also get <br>
other artists to add some tricks here,so hang in there. <br>
<br>
Remember...Your best tool is your imagination...and DON'T give up, <br>
hard practice gives results,always...I know it !!! </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<u>3D Text W/Light Reflection (by biXen)</u><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">First draw a letter using
the line tool,with the width you want.Use antialias to <br>
get the lines smooth looking.Then fill the inner hollowzone <br>
with the same color as the lines. <br>
<img SRC="lws01.gif" ALT="2D Text" ALIGN="center" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="75"> <br>
Then it's time to add a little 3D effect.Draw a thin line on the side you want <br>
to be visible,for the 3D effect,f.x. the right and under sides.Then clean draw it <br>
till it looks nice.Maybe put some blur on places that are to visible. <br>
<img SRC="lws02.gif" ALT="3D Text" ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="75"> <br>
Now lets add a little light effect onto the letter.Use your brush-like tool and <br>
set it to fade to the background color (which you set to white).Then set it <br>
to about 5 steps,and draw from the top corner and down-right,or wherever you <br>
want the effect to be,often it looks better with two effects,it gives <br>
the letter a plastic look which is quite oldskoolish :) <br>

<br>
<u>Grey Ball W/Coloured Fire Effect (by biXen)</u><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">First,make a grey ball,maybe
with the brush tool,to make it seem more round.<br>
Make it smooth in the edges,so it doesnt look like just a circle. <br>
<img SRC="gbf01.gif" ALT="Grey Ball" ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="75"> <br>
Then add some reflections to the ball with your brush tool.Use the same method <br>
as with the text,fade 5 steps to white,and draw some lines,so that it looks <br>
more round and like a ball,iron ball that is. <br>
<img SRC="gbf02.gif" ALT="Grey Ball W/Reflection" ALIGN="CENTER" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="75"> <br>
Then it's time to make the coloured fire effect.Start with a strong color,and <br>
use the fade (30-50) steps to background (black) or transparent.Then draw the <br>
lines from the balls different parts and to the right or left or up or down, <br>
wherever you want the ball to look like it's going.Easy :) </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
