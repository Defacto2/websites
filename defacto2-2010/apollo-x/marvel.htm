Marvel / FC</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">For those who
don't know who Marvel is I can tell you this much. He is<br>
one of the members of the probably most known demogroups ever,<br>
Future Crew. And he is currently working on one of the most <br>
anticipated games of the year with the rest of Remedy Entertainment<br>
in Finland. Check out <a href="http://www.futurecrew.com">www.futurecrew.com</a> and <a href="http://www.maxpayne.com">www.maxpayne.com</a> <br>
to see what I'm talking about.</font></p>

Aki M‰‰tt‰ aka. Marvel / FC</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Hi Marvel, I think we will start with your name,nationality, age,<br>
and which groups you have been in.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
Hi, my name is Aki M‰‰tt‰, but I guess you know me better as<br>
Marvel. I am from Finland and I am 23 years old. I have been in<br>
such Amiga groups as Dark Angels and Sonic and in PC groups<br>
like Sonic PC and mostly in Future Crew.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] : <br>
Tell us a bit about your time with the Amiga groups. When was it,<br>
and what did you do ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
I joined Dark Angels in 1990 via my friends cousin who was<br>
their BBS's sysop. I only did a couple of pictures for them<br>
since DA broke half a year afterwards. I joined Sonic in '93<br>
and did quite a lot of pictures during that time. I have like<br>
10 unreleased fullscreen (320x256 or so) images which<br>
were supposed to end up as a GFX-disk. I guess I'm still<br>
a member of Sonic (nowadays Sonik Clique), atleast<br>
nobody has kicked me out :)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Could you tell us a bit about how and when you started to <br>
pixeldraw and raytrace ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
I used my friends Amiga in '88-'90 and tried out basic&nbsp;stuff in <br>
Deluxe Paint 2. I got my first PC in '89 and&nbsp;started using PC's<br>
DP2 also. For the first two years&nbsp;it was&nbsp; just to pass time and so,<br>
but eventually I&nbsp;realized I might have it to get into a demo group.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">The first time I
encountered rendering was at Pixel's place in'92.<br>
He had gotten 3D Studio v. 2 and showed me some simple stuff he<br>
had done. At that time he had a 486/33 and I only had a 386/40 ,so<br>
I couldn't render without a math coprocessor. But sometime in<br>
'92 or '93 I bought a new machine (486/66) and finally got into <br>
trying some 3D myself. We had a small game-project going on <br>
back then, but never got too far and it basically withered after<br>
the Assembly '93 competition.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
When did you find out that you were getting very good at <br>
raytraced images also ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
That must be a trick question or something , since if you ask<br>
me I haven't yet found out. I guess I could someday, but doubt<br>
it very much since I have so much to learn and hardly can even<br>
cope with everything new.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
A modest master you definately are Marvel. Your pictures<br>
like Elegance and Duality are stunningly made. Do you have<br>
anything to look after when you draw and raytrace ?<br>
For example the beautiful woman in Elegance, that I was<br>
ready to marry when I saw, how did you come up with <br>
her stunningly great looks ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
I might say those pics are okay, but they never got into<br>
what I was aiming towards. I basically did the woman figure<br>
in Elegance just by looking at different images from books<br>
and onscreen. The woman in Dualism started from the same<br>
model, but I actually ended up doing it again in a lot more<br>
detail than the Elegance-version. The lizard in Dualism got<br>
it's textures from various pet-lizard images I found on <br>
the net, but since they weren't too hires, the texture<br>
never got as good as I would've wanted. The looks of the <br>
woman in Elegance is just a combination of basic shape <br>
in the head model and a texture map.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
How and when did you join up with FC then ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
I knew the guys before I joined - basically Gore and Pixel<br>
a bit better. I never had any idea they actually liked my<br>
graphics, so I never asked if I could join. Then one day Gore<br>
commented to me on something I had done and that he <br>
liked it. When I asked he thought I was joking and <br>
answered that I don't really want to join. I told him I did,<br>
so that's pretty much how. This was in the summer of <br>
1992 after Fishtro.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
What do you think is the biggest differences between the<br>
scene when you joined it and how it is today ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
I somehow think the scene has gotten younger and less<br>
organized. Not too many groups understand the meaning<br>
of design and integrity in demos these days. Not too much<br>
progress has happened in the last 5 years. What we need<br>
is someone who does everything 5x better than anybody<br>
previously. Back in '92 - '93 there was only 3-5 real, <br>
stable groups and we pretty much knew eachother and<br>
through that had a better spirit in things.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Did you have any idols when you started out, and if so<br>
do you still have any ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
Of course I had a bunch of them - didn't we all ? At first<br>
('88-'90) I didn't too much know anybodys name, but <br>
later on I came to respect names like RWO, Cougar, <br>
Facet, RA etc. I also liked very much Phenomena's GFX <br>
dude, but can't come up with his name. That old melting<br>
TRSI-logo was at that time the best logo I had seen. I<br>
guess it was made by Joe/TRSI. Now I have pretty<br>
much lost respect towards 2D artists since everybody<br>
tend only to retouch photos and not actually create <br>
something new. But names like Lazur, Made and <br>
Visualize are in the top 2D cast nowadays. If I had to pick<br>
one I'd pick Lazur since he has done so much stuff in <br>
the recent years and most of it is his own stuff, not<br>
copied. In the 3D-field we have a fellow called 3Daddict<br>
who has done some very nice pics and whom I'll try to<br>
beat someday - too bad he does rendered 3D as a job<br>
and I do realtime.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
What is it that takes your time nowadays then ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
What takes my time ? That's something I'd like to <br>
know also :)) Well weekdays are pretty much spent<br>
working at Remedy Entertainment, making levels<br>
and textures for Max Payne. I usually are a bit tired<br>
when I get to my computer after beeing in the gym or<br>
so that I only play Quake 2&nbsp; or listen to some music <br>
and watch TV. I've also done a lot for the Finnish Quake<br>
Scene and my clan Secretum (like webpages for both<br>
of them and&nbsp; organizing some leagues for our scene).<br>
I have a lot of ideas I 'd love to implement if I only had<br>
time. I'm somewhat sad I haven't done so much stuff<br>
during the past couple of years but that just seems<br>
to be how things are. Hopefully I get more time off<br>
after Max Payne is finished so I can do more of my <br>
own stuff.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
I heard in the end of 1998 that FC was making a demo<br>
for 1999. Is that a fact ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
We actually started making a demo even before last<br>
years assembly - We got the idea when we were out<br>
camping and consuming some drinks and talking about<br>
the current state of the scene, or rather the lack of<br>
it. After ASM we held a couple of FC meetings, the<br>
coders did some amazing effects and we got a script<br>
together for our next demo. I guess the whole thing<br>
flopped because us graphicians never got anything<br>
special done and then we just left the whole project.<br>
It might be we'll continue that sometime in the near<br>
future, if we only have time. As some of you might<br>
know, we all are working full-time or studying so<br>
there isn't too much spare time to make demos.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">We also hoped to
make a demo just to get a buzz to<br>
the scene and to wake everybody up.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you ever regret your time spent in the scene ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
No I don't.&nbsp; I'm kinda sad I never got the chance to<br>
show the best of my (questionable :) talent. There <br>
was so much I would've loved to do back in '93-'94<br>
but I never got the chance nor time.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you still watch what happens in the scene ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
Not too much. I only take a look at the graphics<br>
and raytraces every now and then, but I haven't <br>
seen more than two demos after ASM 98. I hear<br>
stuff of course, but don't pay _THAT_ much attention<br>
in general.</font></p>

<font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Unfinished Tales by Marvel/FC</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Your raytraced images, like for example Elegance,<br>
what do you use to&nbsp; make them, and how long does it<br>
usually take ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
I basically first try to come up with an idea and then <br>
start implementing it. I start with one element in the<br>
picture (in Elegance from the chair) and then move to<br>
another. I remember I spent something like 40-60h into<br>
modelling Elegance and then an additional 10h to render<br>
it on my old machine. Dualism however was a bit <br>
different thing. The woman herself took like 60 hours<br>
to model because I had to retouch the mesh _SO_ much<br>
- way too much if you ask me and that meant the whole<br>
image took about 100-120 hours to make. I'll try to make<br>
due with 80-100 hours for ASM '99 raytrace compo pic.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
In your opinion, should demomakers use all the latest<br>
&quot;tools&quot; like 3DFX and mp3's or stick to only regular<br>
DirectX and .xm (mods) ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
When did 3DFX become a tool ? *LOL*&nbsp; I'm not quite sure<br>
what your after with this question but I'd say people<br>
should use, if not the latest, the next latest technology<br>
in demos. So D3D and mp3s are very welcome. But if one<br>
can do great demos using mod-music and dos-box, go<br>
right ahead. The fact is however that it will die out soon.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Which other FC members do you work with in Remedy ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
Besides myself, Skaven, Gore and Henchman are in <br>
Remedy Entertainment. Jake also worked half a year<br>
ago, but went into something quite different.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you have any hobbies ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
It depends what one wants to call hobbies. I could say<br>
doing graphics is a hobby, playing Quake 2 deathmatch<br>
is another. I also listen to a lot of classical music, read<br>
sci-fi and magazines and go to the gym. Spending time<br>
with my brother/sister and my friends also qualify<br>
as a hobby I guess.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Name the things you would do to have the best day<br>
of your life :</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
Wow...a _HARD_ one. I don't think a best day would <br>
depend so much on what I do rather than who I spend<br>
it with. I don't have to accomplish anything really to<br>
make a day the best in my life. Just to spend 12-16 hours<br>
with a wife-to-be in someplace warm,quiet and<br>
relaxing is enough I'd say. :))</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you have any advice for sceners that wants to be <br>
just as good as you ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
Do a lot of stuff, it's that simple. Begin with small things<br>
and try to finish them before starting new stuff. Also try<br>
to do as much as possible by hand and not use like built-in<br>
filters in Photoshop, everybody can tell from the looks of<br>
things. Patience is also a keyword and _DO_ take the time.<br>
Nothing can be done in mere hours, you need dozens and<br>
dozens of em :))) Also having a clear idea and scething it<br>
on paper helps a lot...Well this is only about making<br>
graphics but most of the stuff apply also for making <br>
other things (like music or code)&nbsp; basically. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Okay, finally, do you have any last words or greets<br>
you want to say ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Marvel] :<br>
Nothing special. Of course greetings to everybody I <br>
know personally (in real life or on the net) and hello<br>
to all you guys in Remedy. :) And scene dudes, please<br>
try to enhance the quality of things and stop running<br>
in the same spot from one year to another.<br>
Marvel signing off...........</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Well, thanks a lot to you Marvel, and I think we all <br>
think you deserve a first place at ASM '99 raytrace<br>
compo. And good luck also with Max Payne. </font></p>
