Metal / Vibrants</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">So...you haven't
heard of Metal you say ? Then I guess you<br>
don't like top quality electronic music. Too bad, cause this man<br>
knows his stuff, and he is a true oldskooler. I suggest you read<br>
this interview with this extremely skilled musicmaker, and<br>
then pop into <a href="http://www.vibrants.dk">www.vibrants.dk</a> and click the link to
Metal and<br>
get his music. You won't regret it I'm sure...<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Hi Metal, I think we will start with your name,nationality, age,<br>
and which groups you have been in and are in.<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
Hi biXen. Well, my name is Torben Hansen, I'm danish and 27 years<br>
old. I assume you mean which groups I've been a member of on the <br>
PC.. When I entered the pc in 1992, I was a member of the musicgroup <br>
Vibrants, which I still am actually, but that's another story. <br>
Shortly after that I teamed up with my old mates from the C64-days <br>
and we re-formed Bonzai PC. Bonzai died again in 1994 and a fraction <br>
of the group formed the dutch dominated Analogue (no comparison to <br>
the musicgroup). Analogue is officially not dead, but I left them <br>
sometime in 1998 and joined the danish group Fudge. Not much going <br>
on in Fudge, but the group is still alive... Somehow it seems that<br>
active groups go inactive whenever I join.. hmm.. (smelling my <br>
armpits)</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FF8000"><br>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
How far back do you go in the scene ? Tell us a bit about the<br>
beginning of your scene-adventure.<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
Oh man, I'm as old as they come.. I've been active scenewise since<br>
1986. My first computer was the Commodore 64 and I got into the C64<br>
scene shortly after. I've been active on it untill about 1992 - but <br>
I still manage to do a tune on it from time to time. In 1989 I got <br>
myself an Amiga and started doing music on it. I never really got <br>
thrilled about the Amiga, and therefore I got rid of it in 1991. <br>
Oldtimers may remember the music from my group Upfront's demo <br>
&quot;Cool Fridge&quot;... Anyway, in 1992 I started to compose on the PC making <br>
adlib music in our very own editor called EdLib - developed by <br>
JCH/Vibrants. I made the music for Impact Studios first pc-demo called <br>
&quot;Realtime&quot; - also in 1992 if I remember it correctly.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
[biXen] :<br>
Tell us a bit about when you started to make music.<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
I started making my first pieces of music in 1987 or so. It all began<br>
with the appearance of a program called Sound Monitor. It was the first<br>
really useful musicprogram for the C64, and it became quite popular. <br>
Anyway, as I was very inspired by the music present in the games at that <br>
time (artists such as Rob Hubbard, Benn Dalglish a.s.o.) I started <br>
exploring the SoundMonitor and made some pretty awfull noises in it. One <br>
of the guys in my group at that time had a little-brother, who also <br>
started to make music with SoundMonitor, and he was better than me - way <br>
better - and that really got me going with the music-making! We started <br>
talking a lot about making music - made some music together and listened <br>
to eachothers stuff. This kind of supporting and inspiring eachother <br>
went on for years.. the guy is infact Drax/Vibrants, who is now also a <br>
member of the Maniacs Of Noise. Anyway, sometimes I wonder if I would've<br>
kept on making music if it hadn't been for that inspirational relation.<br>
There's nothing like constructive criticism to keep you going on.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
When did you find out that you started to get good at it ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
I think it was when I started to get feedback on my work. People started <br>
contacting me, complimenting my music and used my music in their<br>
productions. Later on I started seeing my name in the charts and that<br>
made me feel really good.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
I see it difficult to make music, cause I feel I always copy<br>
something others have made. How do you make something so<br>
special and cool, and still unique ? Where do you get it from ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
Well, that's the way you get started. Digging into the music you like. <br>
Exploring the harmonies - the structures - how the sound is created in <br>
the tune. In my opinion there's nothing wrong with &quot;copying&quot; a style as <br>
long as you experience something with it yourself. After all, who makes <br>
music for other people's sake? As long as you don't copy the song itself, <br>
I see nothing but positive things about it. When I started out we all <br>
immitated a lot - trying to sound like Rob Hubbard or Jeroen Tel (yes, he <br>
was also damn famous back then). We even did covers of some tunes - however <br>
that can't be quite compared to the pc-scene as you don't have a universal <br>
tracker such as FastTracker, that you can just load the song into and then <br>
start making your remix. You had to sit down by the piano and figure out<br>
what was played and then make your cover-version.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my point is that if you listen really good to the music you like <br>
and try to make your own music sound that way, you're off to a good start, <br>
coz after a while you'll experience that you suddenly get your own ideas <br>
how to improve on certain things such as panning or whatever, and thereby <br>
achieving a better sound. Also I find that quiet moments by my keyboard <br>
gives me inspiration. But also something as simple as going through samples.<br>
Just listening to them can provide inspiration. Suddenly you hear a sample <br>
that you imagine in your head playing a certain sequence in a song.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
How and when did you join up with Vibrants ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
I got included in the team around Xmas-time in 1992. I've known most of the <br>
Vibrants members for ages - ever since I began to make music really. Anyway, <br>
I was able to join because I was involved in a game-project together with Drax, <br>
and as JCH and JO (2 other Vibrants members) also were involved in the project, <br>
it was most convenient to make it a Vibrants-only project. Also because Vibrants<br>
was infact created as a group with the purpose of making music for games.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
What do you think is the biggest differences between the<br>
scene when you joined it and how it is today ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
Woh.. there are too many differences to describe I think. The biggest difference is<br>
that I'm not 14 anymore - infact I'm closing in on 30. I don't experience the scene<br>
spirit anymore - never did on the pc really. Perhaps that's why I find it difficult<br>
to answer that question... I'm not active in the scene the way I define the term<br>
&quot;scene&quot;.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Did you have any idols when you started out, and if so<br>
do you still have any ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
Oh yes, I had my share of idols in the scene. Mostly other musicians such as the<br>
classic Rob Hubbard and definately the awesome Tim Follin. Later on guys such as<br>
Jeroen Tel and Johannes Bjerregaard totally blew me away. I was also huge fans of<br>
the other Vibrants members music - JCH made completely unique music, which also<br>
made him #1 in the charts for several years. Today I don't really have idols.. <br>
instead I look for inspiration - mostly within Vibrants, but labels such as Level-D, <br>
Tokyo Dawn and Mono make some really great stuff. However I also try to listen to <br>
&quot;new&quot; names, because I often get really surprised by the quality! It's amazing <br>
sometimes. Unfortunately there's also a lot of s... well.. I only wish some people<br>
were more selfcritic about what they release.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
What is it that takes your time nowadays then ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
Work and family mostly. I have a job as an administrative leader of a map division<br>
in a county administration - in charge of implementing and developing Geographic <br>
Information Systems. I've got a MSC in planning and development. Also I'm a familyman <br>
- got a son who is now 3 years old. Composing music is still a great part of my life,<br>
and I manage to find time to release tunes on our homepage <a
href="http://www.vibrants.dk">http://www.vibrants.dk</a><br>
and even make music for games.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you ever regret your time spent in the scene ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
No. Not a single minute of it. It's been fun and innovative for my human development.<br>
It's not that I totally devoted all my time to the scene - I also took my time to play<br>
soccer, drink and party like a maniac and date girls, girls and more girls...<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you still watch what happens in the scene ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
Kind of. I don't watch demos - haven't watched a demo since 1994 I think. Why am I<br>
a member of Fudge then? Well, because they like my music and it's a way for me to<br>
perhaps get more attention in this vast world.. after all - that _is_ what it's all <br>
about, right? :) It's a kind of personal satisfaction I guess.<br>
<br>
And as I said earlier I like to download music from the other groups in the scene.. and<br>
I have contact with a few of them also.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
What do you use to make your music, all tools<br>
needed for productions, and do you use any money on it ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
Everything? Well, I've got an old AMD K6-233 pc (new today old tomorrow). An AWE32<br>
for the sound and a Korg X3 synth. I normally use FastTracker - I've been using <br>
DreamStation a lot lately though. I also make heavy use of softsynths! They can <br>
really make amazing sounds! DSP-tools are used for editing.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
In your opinion, should demomakers use all the latest<br>
&quot;tools&quot; like 3DFX and mp3's or stick to only regular<br>
DirectX and .xm (mods) ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
I definately think they should make use of the technology available. A few years<br>
back I remember discussions like these. Is that ok - or is that not ok.. who cares<br>
really. If a group decides to support that hardware, they either flop or succeed..<br>
all they risk is that their production might not be seen by as many people as it<br>
would, if they only supported things such as DX. And I think that it's definately<br>
ok to use mp3's in demos. It makes life so much easier for the composer - makes it<br>
possible to experiment with the sound and to add that final touch. I think it's<br>
too much oldschool, that some parties still only allow mods with a 1meg limit in<br>
the competition. And often there's not even a mp3-competition. Stupid.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you have any hobbies ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
Yep.. making music ;) Work in my beautiful garden. Painting stuff.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Name the things you would do to have the best day<br>
of your life :<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
What do you mean? Everyday is the next best day of my life =D</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you have any advice for sceners that wants to be <br>
just as good as you ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
As good as me?.. Well.. be yourself. And add a second style to your reportoire!<br>
Techno isn't everything. Neither is pop. Expand your horizons and experiment<br>
as hell!<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Okay, finally, do you have any last words or greets<br>
you want to say ?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Metal] :<br>
First of all I'd like to thank all the people, who played a part in my scene-<br>
life. The list is too long to mention here! Secondly - a big hello to the<br>
guys in Vibrants - we'll rock the next millenium aswell! And last.. a big<br>
hello to the rest of the world surrounding my life. You know who you are!<br>
<br>
And finally.. remember to check out <a href="http://www.vibrants.dk">http://www.vibrants.dk</a><br>
you'll never know what hit you! :)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Thanx a lot for the interview Metal, good luck in the future with both<br>
music, work and your family life :)<br>
