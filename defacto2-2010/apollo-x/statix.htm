Statix / PL</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">If you don't know
who Statix is I suggest you browse<br>
to <a href="gddemos.htm" target="main">&quot;Best Demos&quot;</a> and download <a href="JUICE.ZIP">Juice </a>by Psychic Link,<br>
Statix coded that demo, and that was early in his <br>
PC coding times. He is currently working full-time<br>
for Lionhead with among others old Bullfrog lead<br>
Peter Molyneux. He is now in a new demo group, and<br>
also does great success as a designer in his spare time.<br>
So, here ya got it, interview with the wizkid, Alex Evans.<br>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Hi Statix, I think we will start with your name,nationality, age,<br>
and which groups you have been in.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
Hi, I'm Alex Evans, born March 1978 (so I'm 21 now), I'm Australian<br>
though I've lived in England most of my life. I've been in ... kiddies<br>
play group, no, ehm, Psychic Link to start with, then Acme, Pulse.<br>
But I like to work more like a freelancer. Also I've joined a new<br>
group with Echo and Unreal and some other guys...<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] : <br>
Could you tell us a bit about how and when you started to code?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
I started on an old ZX Spectrum, making games in basic! In about<br>
1991 I got a PC, and coded some more in Basic,then Pascal. In 93<br>
I saw some demos on an Atari ST, and was desperate to make<br>
a tracker for the PC so I could write music. By that time I was<br>
using 100% Assembler... so I made a tracker, and then later,<br>
a demo. We were still learning, and I was still mostly <br>
interested in making trackers.In 1994 I got a job at Bullfrog <br>
and had to learn C pretty fast. I also worked out texture-<br>
mapping at that time. After Juice did well at Assembly 95 I<br>
was completely hooked on demo coding...</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
When did you first see a demo ? And did it do anything to you <br>
at once ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
Yes, like I said, it was my friend S-Cubed who had bought an<br>
Atari ST with loads of mods, a tracker, and some demos.<br>
It was the music that really got me - I'd always wanted to<br>
make my own music and compared to the PC speaker, it<br>
was amazing! So I went to the school electronics lab, and<br>
built myself a little soundcard. Then I made a tracker<br>
and player for it... the rest is history. When I saw &quot;Panic&quot;<br>
on the PC, that was when I realised that it might be fun<br>
to mix graphics with the sound...</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
What do you do to keep up with the technology in your<br>
coding ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
I've always learnt new stuff by watching demos REALLY<br>
closely, and then letting my brain extend the ideas and<br>
come up with new ones. That's the way it's got to work<br>
isn't it ? If your creative you can always improve on <br>
what you see, rather than just copy it... and so, new<br>
things grow from old. Working at Bullfrog and later <br>
Lionhead helped too, because the atmosphere is very<br>
good for creative stuff, it's inspiring, and your <br>
surrounded by clever people who can suggest and <br>
criticise ideas...</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
How and when did you form Psychic Link ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
Psychic Link was formed by S-Cubed and me, after we<br>
saw Panic. I had already made the tracker and player<br>
we needed for the demo.&nbsp; Now all we needed was a <br>
musician to use my new tracker - and another friend,<br>
Skywalker (now a DJ) was in a one man group called<br>
&quot;Psychic Link&quot;. So we joined, and worked hard to<br>
produce act1, back in summer '94. We hadn't seen many<br>
demos, but we were full of ideas. We were going to call<br>
it &quot;Orange&quot; originally, but then by chance we saw<br>
orange greeted in an intro just before release....<br>
Damn! , so Act1 it was...<br>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
What do you think is the biggest differences between the<br>
scene when you joined it and how it is today ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
Back then it was less international, being in a group <br>
meant more because it was probably a friend who<br>
could easily work together. People complain about the<br>
scene being unfriendly to starters now... well it was<br>
then too!&nbsp; Before we showed Juice at the bigscreen<br>
at Assembly '95, absolutely nobody (except Symptom,<br>
thanx guys) would talk to us!&nbsp; These days, internet <br>
allows cooperation, which really suits me (e.g. my <br>
work with Vic) but it sometimes amazes me that so<br>
many beginners expect old-timers to hold their hand<br>
through the internet.&nbsp; We survived without !!!! <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong - helping people is brilliant - but to <br>
EXPECT it from other people who probably don't have<br>
much time seems strange. The scene now is also spread<br>
so wide, with so many groups and productions, it's lost<br>
some of it's original atmosphere that came from it's<br>
relatively small size. Who knows what will come out...<br>
I think it is in a low patch right now, but that's not to<br>
say that there aren't some great productions being<br>
made. It's just that a lot more crap get's <br>
released now....</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Did you have any idols when you started out, and if so<br>
do you still have any ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
Of course, <a href="fc.htm" target="main">Future Crew </a>were the best distributed,<br>
and my first demo inspiration. Once I had got going,<br>
I really respected some of the finnish guys - especially<br>
Hoplite and Dune, and the Halcyon guys - croaker blitz<br>
and Placidity was it who made&nbsp; &quot;Into Dark?&quot;, really<br>
great demo... must be great people ! Now I know a few<br>
more people and my respect continues for them...<br>
Also Unreal is a great guy to be with - infectious <br>
energy ! - and echo produces some great stuff too.<br>
Loads of people in fact.... eh... I really don't &quot;idolise&quot;<br>
anyone in particular but when I see a great demo,<br>
picture or tune or party, I always get a feeling of<br>
awe for the creator(s)... and of course Vic and the <br>
Acme guys, who are great fun to work with, but<br>
you know about that...</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
What is it that takes your time nowadays then ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
In the last year I was finishing my studies, and since then I<br>
have been partying! So PC's and demos have been taking<br>
2nd or 3rd or 4th place to other things...&nbsp; I'm now working<br>
full-time at Lionhead working on games, and it's a big <br>
commitment. I still have my head full of demo-type ideas,<br>
so someday it will overflow and&nbsp; I'll find time to make<br>
something, but I don't know yet! In fact, I don't know <br>
where I will be living after next week, or if I'll go to the<br>
USA next year, or what.... so I'll let you know. Of course<br>
I always watch the demoscene&nbsp; from the corner<br>
of my eye....<br>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
How did you get your job in Bullfrog (now Lionhead) ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
I had a bet with a friend! We were playing Syndicate,<br>
and he bet me&nbsp; I couldn't get a job there. So I phoned up<br>
the number in the Syndicate book and asked for the<br>
address - then I wrote a letter asking for a summer<br>
programming job (since I was at high school then). I <br>
didn't expect a reply, but Peter Molyneux asked me<br>
to come for an interview. At first they laughed at me<br>
for being so young, but then I showed them my tracker<br>
and Act1, and on the basis of that, they gave it to me!<br>
<br>
I couldn't believe it. I was very lucky cause by chance,<br>
I had chosen the exact time that Bullfrog was expanding<br>
massively from 20 people (as it was then) to 200 people<br>
(as it is now, I think). I've always had a good friendship<br>
with Peter, and I kept coming back. When Lionhead<br>
started, with a core of really talented guys, who I all<br>
knew, I was really happy to be asked to join. <br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
[biXen] :<br>
How is it to work with legends like Peter Molyneux ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
Very inspiring - Peter is one of the most talented and <br>
creative people I know, and he has a great ability to<br>
find great people to work with him, and create a <br>
friendly atmosphere. Lionhead is completely his baby:<br>
and it's simply an amazing place to work, the<br>
the atmosphere is inspiringly creative.&nbsp; It's only a<br>
few people and we're all good friends, which helps<br>
a lot. Last year I took a week off work to make<br>
&quot;Bleam&quot;, and Vic came to stay to work on it. <br>
<br>
We almost lived in the office, working 24 hours!&nbsp; <br>
Some of the Lionhead guys helped out, and we all got <br>
together, pissed around, got stoned (well some of<br>
us:)) and made a demo. Vic couldn't believe how<br>
cool it was to work there... and of course Peter<br>
was 200% supportive in his usual over-<br>
generous way.<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
[biXen] :<br>
Does Psychic Link have any plans for further<br>
cooperation ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
Nick (Skywalker) and I are still close friends as we<br>
went to university together, and he lives about 100m<br>
from me in London... he's become a DJ now, and <br>
doesn't follow the scene. But one day I might <br>
persuade him to make me a tune! I've lost track<br>
with S-Cubed, who I think became tired or annoyed<br>
with the scene several years ago... but who knows<br>
what may happen....<br>

Do you ever regret your time spent in the scene?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
NEVER!!!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you still watch what happens in the scene ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
That's one of the best things about the proliferation<br>
of the Internet. I keep my eye on <a href="http://www.scene.org">www.scene.org </a>and <br>
friends... It really depends on how much time I have<br>
to spare, but I always keep it in the back of my mind.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
How long does your part of a demo usually take, and<br>
what tools do you use to do it ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
I am a control freak !!! When I make a demo, I have to <br>
make it completely, and make the code - because for<br>
my style of demo making , a lot of the visual style of an<br>
effect is inside the code. It's for that reason that I never<br>
use a standard 3D engine, and never re-use much code <br>
between projects. So I make no distinction between<br>
design and code, and little distinction between code-<br>
design and art.... <br>
<br>
Normally I'll play around with new technologies <br>
or new techniques, just working on the occasional <br>
free evening, for a month or two. Then a&nbsp; week of<br>
intense coding of ideas, working with the musician <br>
(Vic!)&nbsp; and any other people to think of a&nbsp; form <br>
for the design of the demo. Sometimes that's all <br>
the time I get, but if possible I spend a final few<br>
days to blend all the ideas together. <br>
<br>

<br>
That last bit is normally done at the partyplace, <br>
or certainly when all the people involved in the <br>
demo are in the same room. For tools - pretty normal <br>
stuff! An assembler, a C compiler (these days, <br>
Visual C)&nbsp; Lots of home made tools for compression <br>
and video stuff etc. also Photoshop and Deluxe <br>
Paint 2.... all the standard&nbsp; stuff. For music, I leave it<br>
to Vic!... though whenever&nbsp; I make music (my first <br>
love!) I always use&nbsp; &quot;homemade&quot; trackers. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
In your opinion, should demomakers use all the latest<br>
&quot;tools&quot; like 3DFX and mp3's or stick to only regular<br>
DirectX and .xm (mods) ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
It really depends on what you want to produce, I don't<br>
think there should be hard rules on it. Mp3s are fine,<br>
if you can justify the quality improvement. If your just<br>
mp3ing an .xm file, that seems silly to me. Also 30 meg<br>
demos piss me off !!!&nbsp; As for 3DFX, if they can use it well,<br>
then cool ! I only judge the visual result, not the <br>
technique so much. <br>
<br>
The problem is for 3DFX, so many people can produce<br>
boring quake style&nbsp; 3D flythroughs, and that is VERY<br>
dull. The problems on 3DFX is are not less than with<br>
normal Directx just very different. For example with<br>
&quot;Bleam&quot; I was experimenting, trying to make a 3DFX<br>
demo that had a different feeling to all the other<br>
3DFX stuff of the time. Whether the result was <br>
any good is another question, but it was certainly<br>
unique...</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you have any hobbies ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
I love travelling, especially New York. If I could go there<br>
reguleraly I would! Also swimming when I'm feeling fat...<br>
I've always been a classical musician, so that's another<br>
form of relaxation. Finally, in the last few years I've <br>
really got into some graphical design work, making <br>
posters and flyers for local theaters and clubs.<br>
These are on my website... (<a href="http://www.bluespoon.com">www.bluespoon.com</a>)<br>

Name the things you would do to have the best day<br>
of your life :</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
Oh shit!!! Impossible question. What would I like most to<br>
do today, just at this minute ? That's a bit easier. Teleport<br>
to New York with some friends. Piss around there, maybe<br>
go to a club. Then go jetskiing somewhere. Maybe play<br>
live at some club with some DJ / musician friends.<br>
Go to a cafe/restaurant with some friends.... and wind<br>
up the evening with my girlfriend. Will that do ?<br>
<br>
Alternative: <br>
Sleep till 2pm. Get up. Have lunch. Watch TV. Have a good<br>
shag with a gorgeous woman (no names now...)&nbsp; Go out<br>
for the evening with some mates. Go clubbing in London.<br>
Come back, and wind up the evening with my girlfriend,<br>
that wouldn't be bad either!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you have any advice for sceners that wants to be <br>
just as good as you ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[Statix] :<br>
Be as good as me ? Ha! That's not hard really. Just<br>
waste half your life in front of a PC! Also, study what<br>
you see on the screen in other demos, and as well<br>
as trying to reproduce it, see what ideas it conjures<br>
up in your head.... Just have good time too!&nbsp; The whole<br>
spirit in the scene is embodied in parties, where<br>
everyone gets together to socialize and have<br>
a laugh.</font></p>

Hi to the amazing French scene, all those people are<br>
simply great people. Bah, I can't be bothered to type<br>
anymore! Oh, and greets to Mellow-D because <br>
somehow he didn't get mentioned, but needless<br>
to say he's a total dude.<br>
