<u>1986-1987</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Future Crew (FC) was founded
in the year 1986 on the C-64. And only one <br>
member has been in the group for the whole time - Psi. FC did two demos on the <br>
C-64 before moving into the PC scene in the year 1988. </font><font

<br>
<u>1988</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">FC's first PC demo was a EGA
sinus-scroller called GR8. At that time the <br>
members were HAL, JPM, SS (Psi) and SIDDER. DARK POWER was FC's BBS.</font><font

<br>
<u>1989</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Then there came YO! which
was quite popular for a while. It used one of the <br>
VGA's textmodes and included 'nice' PC-speaker music. It had many scrollers, a <br>
sinusing YO!-logo, a little bouncing ball and a 2D-starfield. At this time ICE joined <br>
and so FC had another BBS - SILICON DRAGON. </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3"

<br>
<u>1990</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">In the year 1990 there was
only one demo release from us, the Slideshow I. It was <br>
the first PC demo which included 4 voice SoundBlaster music. It didn't include any <br>
other special code for it was a VGA picture slideshow. And at this time there were <br>
a lot of members in FC: Psi, ICE, HAL, JPM, SID, BIG, DAC, MAC and SEBU. <br>
Only shortly after Slideshow I, Psi released his Scream Tracker 2.0 - a 4 voice <br>
music editing program inspired by the Amiga SoundTracker. ST 2.0 was a real success. </font><font
face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
<u>1991</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">In summer 1991, FC released
a demo called Mental Surgery. It had a big scroller <br>
on the top of the screen, 3D-starfield, a nice writer, music scopes and of course 4 <br>
voice SoundBlaster music. This was the last FC demo that worked on a 286 <br>
machine. At this time the members were: Psi, ICE, Dr.Venkman and Purple <br>
Motion. Little after this I (GORE) joined FC and ICE lost the interest to demos <br>
and left FC along with his BBS. </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3"

<br>
<u>1992</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">FC lived quietly for about
half a year. But when the year 1992 came Trug, Pixel, <br>
Skaven and Abyss joined FC. And when Abyss joined, FC had a BBS again, <br>
called StarPort. In the beginning of 1992 FC had the following members: <br>
<br>
Psi - Code <br>
Trug - Code <br>
GORE - Organizing <br>
Pixel - GFX <br>
Abyss - BBS Support <br>
Skaven - Music &amp; GFX <br>
Purple Motion - Music <br>
<br>
It was at this time that we had begun making UNREAL. Our first plan was to <br>
release it at MEGA-Leif Convention - An Atari ST/PC party held in Uppsala, <br>
Sweden. But about a month before MEGA-Leif, MeeGosh/Rebels (Amiga) called <br>
GORE and told us about ASSEMBLY'92. He thought that it would be cool to <br>
have also the PC scene there. So, he asked us to do an invitation intro for the PC <br>
scene about this mega-event. We agreed and so, UNREAL was put to rest as Psi <br>
got the idea of making something different - the Fishtro. It took us about two <br>
weeks to create Fishtro from nothing, but when we went to MEGA-Leif <br>
Convention, we still had a few little bugs in it and therefore we couldn't release it <br>
until a week after MEGA-Leif. After we came back from MEGA-Leif, we started <br>
on making Unreal again in order to get it finished for Assembly'92. <br>
<br>
Assembly'92 was held in July, we entered our demo Unreal to the PC demo <br>
competition and won it. Around 1000 people attended this party, which wasn't so <br>
bad as it was being held for the first time. The total amount of PC demo scene <br>
people was 300. After this we were contacted by the organizers of a big <br>
Amiga/C64/PC party, called The Party 1992. They asked us to organize the PC <br>
demo compo there and to make an Invitation Intro for PCs. <br>
<br>
The Party 1992 Invitation Intro was mostly coded by Psi and WildFire. Wildfire <br>
was our new coder who joined us in autumn 1992. He had before been active on <br>
the Atari ST scene. <br>
<br>
Then it was the time for another big demo. The making of Panic began. It was the <br>
normal process of making demos with blood and sweat and annoying deadlines. <br>
Wildfire was the one to assemble the demo together, but lots of code was also <br>
done by Psi and Trug. <br>
<br>
Then it was the time for The Party 1992. As we thought that it would be really nice <br>
to get as many people as possible to The Party as cheaply as possible, we decided <br>
to organize a bustrip there with the Amiga people. So we managed to load two <br>
buses full of computer freaks and start our trip to The Party. At that time The Party <br>
1992 was the biggest demo party ever. There were about 2500 computer freaks of <br>
which around 300 were PC dudes. There we entered the demo compo with Panic, <br>
and to our surprise we came second. Witan's Facts of Life had won the demo <br>
compo. We were quite disappointed by this, because there was absolutely no <br>
voting. The voting system on Amiga just didn't work. And then some Amiga <br>
organizer just asked the last remaining PC organizer (A member of Danish Elite) <br>
&quot;What do you think were the best PC demos?&quot; without telling him that these were <br>
going to be the official results. And without thinking the PC organizer just said <br>
&quot;Witan's, FC's and Sonic's&quot;. However, The Party 1992 was a nice party. </font><font

<br>
<u>1993</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">After The Party 1992 we
lived quietly for a while. The only big change was that <br>
Marvel (formerly in Sonic Amiga) joined us. We now had two GFX artists. Then <br>
we began thinking of making a diskmag (Worldcharts). At first nobody really <br>
wanted to code it, so we thought that we would make it as a co-operation with <br>
Stone (a finnish demogroup). But after some co-operation trouble we began <br>
making it 100% by ourselves. Only the first issue was released. Then we decided <br>
to stop making it, for we had other more important projects to attend to. Then it <br>
was the time for Assembly'93. Once again we were the PC organizers and we <br>
made an invitation intro about it. <br>
<br>
Assembly'93 was the biggest summer demo party ever. There were about 1500 <br>
people on the party place of which around 550 were PC demo freaks. Asm'93 <br>
was also a big advancement on the PC side. For the first time we also had an intro, <br>
a music (4 channel and multichannel) and a graphics competition. Second Reality <br>
was also first presented at Assembly'93. <br>
<br>
Next was The Party 1993 (also known as The Party 3), and all we can say is that it <br>
wasn't such a good party as it could have been. This was NOT the fault of the PC <br>
organizing group Access Denied, but instead it seemed that the Amiga organizers <br>
had underestimated the PC side and thus treated the PC side somewhat unfairly. <br>
Already there is some talk about organizing a PC-only party for X-mas'94. <br>
Anyway, we released the GUS version of our old Assembly'92 winner demo <br>
Unreal, and Purple Motion's musicdisk called Journey (which also includes the <br>
MDP - our MOD/S3M player for GUS/SB/SBPro). </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3"

<br>
<u>1994</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Future Crew is now almost 8
years old. We had big plans for this year, both in the <br>
demo scene and in the commercial market. We organized Assembly '94 with <br>
Accession, Sonic PC, Virtual Dreams and The Movement. It was a big party, with <br>
about 3000 visitors. It was held on August 5th- 7th in the center of Helsinki (the <br>
capital city of Finland). Many people expected that FC will release a demo at <br>
ASM'94, and we too planned to do so. We had the demo designs ready, it would <br>
have been called 'The Probe', but due to the fact that we wouldn't have been able <br>
to make it satisfactory in time for ASM'94, we decided not to rush it ready. The <br>
project was later forgotten altogether due to a few commercial projects took most <br>
of our time. <br>
<br>
Our major release this year has been the long-awaited Scream Tracker 3, a project <br>
which has been in the making for over 2 years. <br>
Traditionally, FC visited The Party '94, which was held again in Herning, Denmark, <br>
just after Christmas. We didn't make a demo for TP'94. </font><font

<br>
<u>1995</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">The year 1995 has been so
far very quiet for The Future Crew. No new releases <br>
this far. Our biggest hindrance this year has been the Finnish Army, which happens <br>
to be mandatory for all Finnish guys. This year, first we lost Wildfire and Marvel <br>
there in January, and then Pixel and Abyss in July. The military service lasts 8-11 <br>
months, depending on the branch and your 'skills'. This has left Future Crew with <br>
little resources to spare for demo-making. <br>
<br>
Although this year Future Crew was not officially linked with Assembly Organizing, <br>
or Assembly '95, we were there. Most of us were there as visitors, but Jake and <br>
Henchman organized the PC demo and Intro competitions (along with many other <br>
things that were going to fail otherwise). This was the first time in history of big <br>
demo parties, that there were no mishaps in the PC Demo competition! Skaven <br>
and Purple Motion participated to the 32 channel music competition, and both <br>
placed well: Purple Motion placed eight and Skaven won the competition by a <br>
WIDE margin with his song Catch That Goblin. <br>
<br>
The disappearance of Starport was the result of Abyss joining the army for his <br>
compulsory military service. There was nothing dramatic to the end, Abyss just <br>
didn't have any time to keep the system running. </font><font face="Haettenschweiler"

<br>
<u>1996</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">1996 was big year for Remedy
Entertainment. Remedy produced their first game, <br>
called &quot;Death Rally&quot;. </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3"

<br>
<u>1997</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">As all of you must have
noticed we have been keeping quiet =). All of the coders <br>
are involved in the Pyramid project and a number of members are working for <br>
Remedy Entertainment. <br>
<br>
But we haven't been completely dead as you can see from the results of <br>
ASSEMBLY'97. Pixel took two second places, in graphics and in wild demo <br>
categories. Marvel took the third place in raytrace compo. <br>
<br>
Also the Pyramid 3D card was showcased at ASSEMBLY '97 and also Final <br>
Reality, Remedy 3D benchmark, was premiered at ASM '97. <br>

Remedy working on MaxPayne. Not much time for making demos,but Trug told me that <br>
they are working on a new demo together,not coming before 99. <br>
