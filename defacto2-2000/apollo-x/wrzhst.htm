<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The History Of
The Warez Scene&nbsp;&nbsp; (unfinished)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Piracy has always
existed on all systems for as long as computers have <br>
existed. Another known fact is,that most likely, a program that's written<br>
will be dewritten (taken apart) 1000 times faster than the time it took to<br>
write it. Since the PC cracking scene really took off in late 80's and early<br>
90's it has gone through many stages. Many thought it would die off when <br>
the CD-ROM's started to get into our lives. But the cracking scene survived<br>
and will probably live forever if you ask me. Many programmers have tried<br>
to code algorithms and tricks to make programs uncopyable. But for the<br>
many skilled crackers out there, nothing is a problem. Most of the crackers<br>
actually end up as programmers and coders for games and programs <br>
themselves in the future. And many coders that work in gaming companies<br>
etc. now, started out in the scene themselves.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Let's look at the
beginning of the scene as we know it today. It all started<br>
on the old Commodore 64 computers. Mostly teenagers existed in this <br>
scene. And cracking programs wasn't very hard in those days either.<br>
The spread of these games wasn't very wide. It happened mostly around<br>
where the pirates lived. And wasn't a specially broad scene,though it<br>
existed everywhere there was C64's. I remember myself, my pals that<br>
had C64 only had copied games, no originals. I myself had an Amstrad<br>
computer. We had no copied games,only originals, that was mainly<br>
because almost noone else in Norway had Amstrad, only C64. Though<br>
the Amstrad was better,and had just as many cool games. The <br>
Amstrad was more known in England than the rest of the world.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">According to
sources, it is said that the PC cracking scene actually<br>
took off around 1987. That's when people started to spread games<br>
they had cracked, and started to form groups. Before that only<br>
individuals had done the cracking, maybe credited themselves in<br>
the game. Let's take a look at the now most important scene:<br>
&quot;The Pc cracking scene&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">It is really
difficult to find out anything about the oldskool cracking<br>
scene. The only source is the people that was in it. Many of them<br>
are in their mid 20's and maybe 30 now, so they are not easy <br>
to reach. But I will try to get some interviews with oldskoolers.<br>
Because of the PCs actually poor system (x86) the system was<br>
very limited in the beginning. Therefore no cracktros were made<br>
and few info files written. So digging up info about this time is not<br>
easy. But more and more is now known. And revealing new stuff<br>
is a process that many is contributing to.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">As said earlier,
individuals first cracked the games. They leaved<br>
notes in the downright corner f.x. saying &quot;Cracked by Nomade&quot;.<br>
In the late 80's groups started to emerge, and cracking groups<br>
got more known and common. These groups often had CGA<br>
images or animations or ANSI's to credit themselves of the <br>
cracks. Bentley Sidewell Productions is said to have made the <br>
first cracktros, because they credited themselves with CGA<br>
animations in their cracks. The old cracktro scene is also said<br>
to be the origin to the PC Demo Scene. This scene emerged when<br>
the people making cracktros found it cooler to make cracktros<br>
than actually cracking. International Network of Crackers<br>
used ANSI in their cracks, not as fantastic as BSP but also a <br>
start of something better.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">It is said that
hacking groups were the start of the shorting of<br>
groups names. This was both to confuse and for easier typing.<br>
3 lettered shorts wasn't common before the PC times, this was<br>
mainly because the PC's limitations with DOS. 11 characters only. <br>
(eight . three) First info files started out only when the cracking<br>
groups wanted to inform the users of something, maybe keys in<br>
the game or something special. Later they started to add info<br>
files regularily in every release. It started with naming the info<br>
files with the game name followed by .DOC (document) f.x. <br>
Simcity.doc . Later some groups started to use the acronyms<br>
of their groups instead of .doc like Simcity.INC.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">In 1990 The
Humble Guys introduced us to the now standard .nfo<br>
ending of the files. NFO standing for information. First the standard<br>
was gamename.nfo like Simcity.nfo , but as we all now know the <br>
standard eventually became groupname.nfo.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">To talk a bit
about couriers we can begin to say that their <br>
position has never been very seen upto. They are in fact a very<br>
important part of the scene, because they spread, but the <br>
reason that they are not very high seen is that anyone can<br>
courier, you don't need special skills, just equipment. In the <br>
beginning, most of the couriers were both hackers and pirates,<br>
and pirating was often not toprated, that led to slow spreading<br>
of games. Another bad thing was that noone was willing to pay<br>
high phone bills to spread games, so this didn't become any good<br>
before a new alliance was formed. This was called North American<br>
Pirate Phreak Alliance (NAP/PA). They worked to spread knowledge<br>
of phreaking to pirates, so that they could call for free and so on.<br>
This got the scene more united, and the borders came closer.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">As I said a bit
earlier, the couriers wasn't very high seen. And<br>
one example of this is when the Humble Guys started to call their<br>
couriers for slaves. They each got one number , like slave09 and<br>
logged onto boards anonymous. Time Lord changed his nick to the<br>
Slave Lord for the couriers. He would be their master. Here you<br>
can see part of the app to be a slave :</font></p>

you are slave quality.<br>
<br>
1) If I asked you to jump, what would your reply be? ________________<br>
2) Do you believe in the use of K-Y jelly, or do you like it straight up? ___<br>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">As you can see
they was very looked down to, and even today this is a fact.<br>
That is due to the fact that many people have very good lines and big <br>
harddisks, so to be a great site is easy. Because of this, the most common<br>
thing today is separate crackgroups and courier groups. This has almost<br>
became a standard. Here is also a member listing from the Humble Guys from<br>
1993. As you can see the couriers are listed as peasants.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">I often sometimes
hear oldskoolers talk about how the scene was<br>
before. And I would really like to be part of the old scene, where<br>
they often just crossed country borders to spread games instead<br>
of sending them with their 2400bps modems. One story is of an <br>
oldskooler that visited a n online pal from&nbsp; another side of the&nbsp; country<br>
with a game. His pal sat and tried to crack the game while he<br>
messed with his sister. There are many old stories about the <br>
scene. It was truly great times, thats no shit. But these times<br>
are over. Now it's a new scene. Still a good scene, but there have<br>
been a lot of changes compared to the old days. For example it's<br>
much easier to be a newbie these days and that's actually a good<br>
thing. In the old days people that wasn't any good in cracking and<br>
so on wasn't welcome to learn it either, that didn't exactly<br>
recruit many new crackers so these days weren't anything to <br>
brag about. This behaviour probably came from the fact that<br>
the Scene was very closed at those times, and only respected<br>
people could do the things they wanted to, not like these days,<br>
where everything is available on the net. Those days you had<br>
to have a BBS number to call. And you mostly had to have friends<br>
that could get you into the top BBS's.&nbsp; To the oldskoolers I got only<br>
one thing to say : &quot;If you aren't satisfied with todays scene,why<br>
be a wussy and quit ? Help us get it as good as before again <br>
instead. If not, don't complain, though we know all was better<br>
before, that does also our parents say ,about life......&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">BBS's these days
often had to pay monthly fees to be affiliated<br>
with groups. These money often came from leech account<br>
payment from people. The groups used this money in many <br>
ways, perhaps most often to get games to release. If a group<br>
didn't have any money, they had trouble getting out any new<br>
games. BBS runners had to put money in it to be top rated.,<br>
and the only thing they got back was respect (and new <br>
releases ofcourse). It was also quite dangerous to run a <br>
BBS in your home. The big software companies was always<br>
after scapegoats for the whole scene. Many big BBS's have<br>
been busted this way. It is said that the death of BBS's came<br>
after Park Central closed down. This was the number one<br>
BBS in the scene and was often used as a referee beeing<br>
both the boxing ring and the referee.&nbsp; In the end many <br>
groups started to release on the Internet only and they<br>
had to make two different scorecharts, one for BBS and<br>
one for the Internet. The BBS's final hour is said to be<br>
the infamous Cyberstrike campaign of February 1997 <br>
where 5 major BBS's were closed down in few days.<br>
This caused many other BBS owners to close down in<br>
fear of getting busted themselves.</font></p>
