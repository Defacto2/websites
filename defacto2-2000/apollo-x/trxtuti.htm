<u>-Effects</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">There are a number of effect
commands available in the newer trackers that we <br>
didn't discuss in Section 1. Be sure that you are familiar with all the <br>
standard commands before you embark this next voyage of discovery. These <br>
effects -have- to be used properly, or they can completely destroy what <br>
would otherwise be a good track. <br>
<br>
Let&#146;s start with Stereo Panning. This is the method by which a sound <br>
appears to come from a certain place between the speakers. </font><font
face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
<u>- Techniques</u> </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Do you use echoes on various
parts of your MODs? If not, why not? They <br>
are an easy way of filling out the sound. Really easy to do as well. Simply<br>
copy a channel into another empty channel, change the volume of the channel<br>
down to under half of its current volume, and insert a row in only that <br>
channel. Play back the pattern, if it sounds nice, you've succeeded. <br>
Inserting only a single row will only work well at slow BPMs, however,<br>
so keep on inserting and playing back until it sounds nice. <br>
<br>
One point to remember, and this is something I've seen in many MODs, <br>
even ones produced by masters (I won't give any names), is that if the <br>
echo is fairly long a few notes will be chopped off the end of the echoed <br>
channel when you insert rows. But these notes still exist in the original <br>
channel. When the tune is played back the echo will appear to stop at the <br>
beginning of each pattern, and then start again. This reduces the 'live' <br>
feel of the entire module. Just remember to copy the chopped notes onto <br>
the beginning of the next pattern in the playing list, and everything <br>
will sound fine. <br>
<br>
Another cool effect (IMHO) is gating. This is usually done with command<br>
A. Load a long/looped sample and set it to maximum volume. Now input the<br>
channel below (The notes can be anything, but keep the effects the same)<br>
(No Volume Column) <br>
<br>
C-5 1 A0F - Starts note, slides volume <br>
--- 1 A0F - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
--- 1 A0F - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
--- 1 A0F - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
--- 1 A0F - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
--- 1 A0F - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
--- 1 A0C - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
--- 1 A08 - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
E-5 1 A0A - Starts note, slides volume <br>
--- 1 A0A - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
--- 1 A08 - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
--- 1 A06 - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
D-5 1 A08 - Starts note, slides volume <br>
--- 1 A08 - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
--- 1 A06 - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
--- 1 A04 - Sets volume to sample default volume, then slides volume <br>
<br>
Now play, and you should find that you get this choppy sound that gets <br>
less choppy with the slower slides. That choppiness is gating. Gating <br>
works best when used on strings and vocals, but just play around and <br>
see what you come up with. </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<u>- Sampling</u> <br>
<br>
<u>- Filtering</u> </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">There are a number of
features available in most good sampling programs<br>
that can be used to improve the quality of the sound. First of all we&#146;ll <br>
take a look at filters, usually there will be some sort of controllable <br>
low/high pass filter that you can use. <br>
<br>
One purpose of using a low pass filter is to remove any noise from a low<br>
pitched bass sample, it can also at fatness up the sample as well. The <br>
most important thing to remember is not to use a low pass which lets <br>
too high frequencies through. A low pass of about 8kHz seems to work <br>
fine in removing noise from most bass samples. </font></p>
