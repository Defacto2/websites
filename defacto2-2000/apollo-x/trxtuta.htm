<u>- Introduction</u> </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">The essential thing to
remember when you're at this stage is that <br>
everything must be professionally done, whether it's sampling, <br>
tracking, and use of effects, absolutely everything must be at top <br>
quality. Take your time over your tracks, and make sure that they <br>
are as perfect as you can get them. </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3"

<u>- Vocals</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Chances are that some time
or other you are going to want to <br>
incorporate some sort of vocals into your music. This can be very <br>
hard, and there are two important things to remember: the vocalist,<br>
and the words. Both should be of equal importance in your mind. A good<br>
vocalist singing crap words sounds unprofessional, the same goes for a<br>
crap vocalist singing great words. Few people can sing well, and even <br>
fewer can write respectable songs. <br>
<br>
Your best chance of getting good vocals is to find someone who is <br>
willing and able to write some lyrics for you, and then hire a studio<br>
and a vocalist for a couple of hours. The main reason for hiring a <br>
studio is that it'll probably have VERY expensive and VERY nice <br>
microphones. They'll know all about using them and have the best <br>
environment to record in. Remember that you'll probably want to take<br>
a recording of your tune with you so the vocalist will have something <br>
to sing to! You can then sample the vocals and incorporate them into <br>
your tune. Obviously you'll have to check that the studio has a sampler<br>
that can save onto disks that you can use. The actual sample format <br>
isn't too important as there are plenty of converters around. <br>
<br>
An alternative method would be to find out if the studio has a CD- <br>
Recorder. You can then record the vocals direct to CD and rip or <br>
sample them at your leisure. The same goes if you have a DAT machine,<br>
you could record to DAT in the studio and then sample the vocals <br>
when you want. <br>
<br>
Using vocal samples does have a number of drawbacks. One, your <br>
modules will instantly increase in size. We&#146;re not talking a few <br>
hundred KB here, more like a good few megabytes, depending on the <br>
amount of vocals used. <br>
<br>
Another problem is one of performance. Although this may not bother<br>
you, if you&#146;re playing a song to an audience, and there&#146;s no-one <br>
singing it, the performance will look quite strange! </font><font face="Haettenschweiler"

<u>- Going Commercial</u> </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Releasing commercially when
you use a tracker is nigh on impossible,<br>
due to the lack of respect trackers have from 'proper' musicians. <br>
There have been, and will be, a lucky few who have done it. Names <br>
that spring to mind are Bjorn Lynne (Dr. Awesome), Dex + Jonesey, <br>
Eric Giesen (Sidewinder), Vivid, Ganja Man, Holy Ghost, Oona, <br>
Assign. The main problem with getting your music released is the <br>
output format. Here's a short table to determine whether or not <br>
you'll have this problem. <br>
<br>

Basically, as long as you have a CD-Writer or a good quality digital<br>
output and DAT machine, you won't have a problem getting a good <br>
quality recording. Which means you'll be able to produce good quality<br>
demos without the need to hire a professional (!) studio or mastering<br>
company. <br>
<br>
Something else to consider when you're going professional is the <br>
quality of your samples. The number of times I've heard a tune good <br>
enough to be released that has been spoiled by bad samples is <br>
ridiculous. Drums are generally the culprits,especially those with<br>
high frequencies in them. Synthetic hi-hats and cymbals pitched up <br>
too far lose their distinctive sound, and get changed back into what<br>
they really are white noise. Don't settle for anything less than CD-<br>
Quality, unless you specifically want that &quot;lo-fi&quot; sound. </font><font
