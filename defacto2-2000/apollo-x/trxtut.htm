<p align="center"></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">This is a
small tutorial on how to make cool computer music,using just your, <br>
imagination,computer and a tracking program.It's called tracking,that is because you <br>
put the different instruments and samples in tracks,and the combined tracks make the <br>
song.Samples can be anything,for example an old lady screaming or something... <br>
<br>
The tutorial is mainly done by Matthew Coulson (Cools),but I (biXen) will add more <br>
tutorials and update this page frequently,the other submissions will also be credited. <br>
I will also get other trackers to add some tricks here,so don't give up just yet !<br>
<br>
Remember...Your best tool is your imagination...and DON'T give up, <br>
hard practice gives results,always...I know it !!! <br>
