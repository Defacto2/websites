12-22-1~~~Dupecheck.com Closes~~~12:35 PM~~~<a href="http://www.dupecheck.com">www.dupecheck.com</a> the world famous search site was taken down by it's owners after a conflict of interest with the B.S.A. Here is what the webpage says ..<br>
Sorry people, Dupecheck doesn't exist anymore. We decided to take it down.
<br>
Why ?
It seems that the information about a release (filename, groupname, ...) is already a problem for the BSA because it helps to find pirated software.
You all know that we don't have pirated software here but we don't wont to get too much trouble with the BSA so we took it down.
Please don't ask when Dupecheck will come back or where because it wont ...
We thank all people who helped to make dupecheck what it was.

12-8-1~~~Sceners Go Nintendo~~~4:54 PM~~~A bunch of sceners (active and inactive) from a variety of scenes (ansi/demos/warez) have gotten together to form a company that develops Game Boy Color games. Some of the group names that the people were involved with include ACiD, Beyond, ICE, Razor 1911, Renaissance, TRSi and Xography. Judging from those names you can see an all star list. They have recently released a new little music album on the Game Boy at <a href="http://www.paragon5.com">www.paragon5.com</a> in keeping to their scene roots.~~~scenenews@defacto2.net~~~~~~Scenenews~~~~~~
