3-27-1~~~The Faction Returns (With Byte)~~~3:52 PM~~~The Faction, the group or association everyone seems to love to hate has return. And this time with MythPC, Class and Divine holding hands. They have all decided to agree to this statement listed below.
<p><pre>
  In 1998, three people decided the future of how the scene should shape
  itself and released a 10-point information document stating how a game
  release should be conducted. In the past year, many of these rules have
  been broken by its founding members and other groups have purposely
  broken the agreement. In lieu of recent events, the deciding figures
  of three groups, Class, Myth & Divine, have converged and agreed upon
  a new set of rules based on the original Faction rules and Myth's
  recent proposal and have been updated, modified and agreed upon by a
  consensus to a new standard to better suit the scene in this millenium.
  These groups have been active participants in shaping the scene in the last
  6 months, and were given active participation in voicing their point of
  view. These new rules will allow for a more fair and competitive scene
  while ensuring a quality-minded environment for the scene. These deciding
  figures have bestowed themselves to be called the N.S.A., Network Software
  Association. These rules have been ratified and approved among the three
  groups and will be recognized and followed immediately on this date,
  March 26th, 2000.

  1.  The disk  limit  is as of  now  65 x 2,915,000 bytes. This equates  to a
      total  of 189,495,000 bytes of compressed data. Groups may not go over
      the total size to prevent any future cheating. Acceptable compression
      formats at this  time are ACE or RAR or any future compression that
      supports multiple volumes and long file names, followed by the
      traditional PKZIPing.

      The limit for standard game add-ons is 35 x 2,915,000 bytes for any add-
      on that includes Music, Speech, Commentary or Play By Play for the
      original release. Any add-on that does not fit this criteria will be
      restricted to 25 x 2,915,000 bytes. Only the group that won a game
      release is allowed to release the add-ons for the game.
 
  2.  To prevent sloppy rips, a re-release of a game is allowed to make groups
      release proper and respectable releases. The following provisions
      include:

      a) it can be ripped in >=10 disks less than the previous release by us-
         ing only lossless compression methods. Lossy compression will not be
         permitted to compromise the release to fit under this condition.

      b) it can be ripped in >=15 disks less of the size of the previous
         release by using mp3-compression while not downgrading any wavs
         or mp3's sound quality using lossy compression.

      That means all the essential gamedata must be still included in the re-
      release. No essential data is allowed to be removed to be considered a
      valid re-release. A re-release from a competing group may not use tools,
      original crack or any other files from the previous release that were
      modified for the original game rip.

      The re-release of a rip can be done by any group and must be done in
      at most 48 hours after the release of the original rip, as possibly
      every game is rippable in a smaller size if enough time is spent.

  3.  Every release  under  this  limit MUST be  a functionally  and  playable
      complete  game with no essential data missing to complete the game.
      This  means  that  included  will  be  every  component necessary for
      the successful completion of the game e.g.:

      - all game executables that are needed,
      - every level (single AND multiplayer),
      - every track (including practice),
      - all actor graphics & models etc,
      - sound effects
      - registry settings to play on the Internet (e.g. Zone/DirectPlay)

  4.  Any lossless compression method to reduce the size of selected game data
      is ALLOWED (e.g. uharc).

  5.  Lossy compression is ALLOWED for  sound, videos and non-texture graphics
      (e.g. jpeging of menu screens) but lossless compression is encouraged
      before using lossy compression.  Lossy compression of textures is expli-
      citly FORBIDDEN to  prevent the  many  problems inherent to that.

  6.  Sound effects WILL and MUST be included. To reduce the size of rips when
      possible, standard waveformat files (PCM) should be mp3-compressed
      if possible in a reasonable state of time and is over the size of 20
      disks. If the soundfiles exist inside a bigfile its highly regarded
      when time is invested to extract those files to compress them.  Groups
      are not to required to index bigfiles though. Downgrade of sound quality
      to sound files to allow the game to fit the limit will not be permitted.

      It is allowed to rip music, commentary/speech and ambience files as long
      as the game remains playable.  Speech files  MUST be  included if  there
      exist no on-screen subtitles. It is okay to remove commentary from a
      release if size does not permit it.

      It is highly regarded when all sounds, speech and music are included in
      a rip and not intentionally put out as addons.

  7.  It is allowed to remove gamedata that exists in multiple resolutions or
      formats as long as the  game remains playable on a typical system  which
      is defined by a PII-300 with a D3D-card and soundcard.

      - high-resolution textures for highend systems.
      - low-resolution textures for low-end systems if there is no
        possible options to include the high-resolutions in the release.
        If size permits, it is expected that high resolution be released
        as an add-on.
      - high-screen resolution graphics data standard of 800x600 (or 640x480
        if other than 800x600 is not applicable)
      - at least one hardware-dependent data must be included, and must be
        in Direct3D mode or any other hardware data modes that are accepta-
        ble (e.g. Glide textures). A release of software mode only with all
        hardware-dependent data and textures removed will not be allowed in
        future releases.

  8.  Movies (intros, cutscenes) should be removed if they aren't game-related.
      Movies must be  ripped in a  way so that the  gameplay experience is  not
      compromised, e.g. framing of movies is highly regarded.  It should always
      be avoided  to  create  situations in  which  user-input is  necessary on 
      black screens because the video normally shown has been blacked out.

  9.  Other allowed add-ons for games include:

      - cutscenes/movies
      - commentary/speech
      - music
      - manual/documentation
      - editor

      Intro and Outro add-ons are EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN.  Not more than 2 add-ons
      should be released for a game release.

  10. Children's games (aka  Kiddie  games) and  Edutainment  software  do not
      qualify  under these rules  guidelines for acceptable  releases.  Kiddie
      games are usually defined via the game target audience of  '5-12 years'
      as stated by the game's producer.  Common  sense should  be based on
      common sense  by  all groups to identify what really is a kiddie game.
      Platform games are not to be considered kiddie games.

  11. Levelpacks, game add-ons etc. for rips are only allowed if they are offi-
      cially released/authorized by the  same company/developer/publisher that
      put out the original game. If possible by its size, the add-on should be
      made as a standalone and not needing the original game release. The
      original missions may be removed to allow the game add-on to become
      standalone if not size can not permit the original game. It should be
      explained in the NFO if and why a game add-on isn't made to be standalone.

  12. In regard  to games  distributed  in the  United States  that are  LATER
      distributed in Europe  or vice versa under  the same or different name /
      publisher.  These games  if released  AFTER another group's  release are
      counted  as DUPES  unless  it can  be  proven that  there  is  a clearly
      noticeable  PLAYABLE  difference in the  latter release  (more than just
      tiny differences in graphics or sound). Differences in filedates and
      Game Titles between Euro and US releases are NOT a good enough reason to
      re-release the game.

  13. A brief  outline  of what  has been  stripped from the  game  should  be
      clearly stated in  the  game-release .NFO, as  well as information as to
      whether or not Add-Ons can be expected.

  14. Fully cracked Update Patches and Trainers are highly  regarded, though
      they are not  the responsibility  of any group (including  that of which
      released the original game).  If 2 trainers from the same  or  different
      groups are released  for 1 game, this  does NOT qualify as a dupe unless
      the latter trainer provides no new features over the prior trainer. Beta
      update patches will not considered a valid release among any game group.
      No group shall release a cracked patch for a game if a generic patch
      exists for a particular game in the scene. If a generic crack exists, a
      new patch-release must specify that the generic crack does not work
      anymore.

  15. If two or more rips of the same game get released, the first working rip
      wins.  Sites should not nuke any  release until the winning rip has been
      proven to work correctly and follows the above ruleset.

  16. No group shall do a rip using another's groups work, be it an iso crack
      or tools written by another competing group. Any third party tools shall
      be acceptable. A crack from an ISO or past release (even in other
      languages) shall not be used unless permission is given from the
      cracker/creator of the original release group.

      All appointed HQ (Headquarters) should abide by these rules to the
      fullest extent permutable. Any group that competes in the gaming rip
      scene will and must abide by the above rules to allow fair competition
      among all competitors.

      Signed,
      Leaders, Council Members and Seniors of Class, Myth & Divine.

3-26-2~~~MythPC Rebuts Class~~~3:28 PM~~~After Class’s statement on what they thought of the contribution to the RIP scene by their competition. MythPC have decided to retaliate with a few words of their own ..
<p><font color="red">
Note: MythPC have recently hinted that they will come to an agreement with the other 'main' RIP groups for new operating standards.
<p></font>
<pre>
You might have seen yesterday's release of 'NFS5_Final-CLS' and read the
   nfo that came with it. We want to answer a few of those accusations that
   those 'classy' people made:
   
   a) Our NFS 5 Porsche release was the EUROPEAN boxed final version. Like
      all other native-built european versions, ours had a version.txt
      with '3.0' in it, being the reason for not being compatible with the
      USA version. All rules still forbid to dupe euro-releases with games
      that come out later or in a different version in USA (and there are NO
      gameplay differences, contrary to what CLS says. There CAN'T be game-
      play differences as all the files except for the localized gfx are 
      identical).
      
   b) CLS knew about this - they DELIBERATELY duped our release, as they had
      the german iso already when they threw out their dupe release.
   
   c) You always have to wonder when CLS wildly throw accusations and never 
      ever put any proof to them, like comparisons of dirlists etc.

   d) Imperium Galactica II was a german store final - that included the 
      english text etc. CLS had this version as well and were just too DUMB to
      figure out that if you just deleted the GER\ folder with the german files,
      the game would be english. 
      
   e) We really wonder how a group like CLS can even try and blame other groups
      for bad ripping. Our Nascar 2000 is a fully working rip and follows all
      known ripping guidelines - set by CLS themselves. CLS should maybe look
      into their own past for really bad rips, like SpecOps 2 or System Shock 2.
      Or have they already forgotten about Risk II and Majesty this week and the
      need for fixes for them ? All groups make mistakes, and CLS should be the
      last to throw stones - not the first.
      
   f) MYTH acknowledges that our Force Commander rip was not working and a repack
      was due - CLS was just faster to do that. Kinda silly from then that their
      repack was 7 disks bigger, while they didn't forget to mention that they 
      were able to pack NFS5 3 disks better - in only one week after the original 
      release by MYTH - and that after claiming that they would be able to do it
      in under 50 disks.
      
   To summarize, we feel kind of sorry for the few good people in CLS, who are 
   getting so horribly abused by a moronic leadership. All evil empires fall 
   eventually, so there is still hope for them :)
</pre>~~~scenenews@defacto2.net~~~~~~Scenenews~~~~~~
3-26-1~~~Class Pays Out On MythPC~~~3:16 PM~~~Class for the first time in a long time have released a public statement concerning the competition in the RIP scene. In fact it is more of a direct flame at MythPC and the way they do their business. Here is the statement in full ..
<p><pre>
Like Myth's beta, we could not get this under 50 disks. While we did
   compress it better than Myth's release, it still couldn't get it under 50
   disks. Since the beta was over the limit, this game deserves to be over the
   limit as well since it's well-anticipated. When the disk limit will be
   raised remains to be seen. We'll try to upheld to the 50 disk limit unless
   it isn't possible.

   Myth should be ashamed. Yet again they burn the scene by slipping out a
   game that is claimed to be final, when it isn't. CLASS wants everyone
   to play the final version that they can find in stores, not a hacked-up
   version stamped as beta. Now Myth has been caught again, and look who
   has to clean up the mess.

   The proof that Myth's NFS5 was beta? Check the version # in version.txt:
   Myth: 3.0
   Class: 3.2

   There are multiple difference in the cars and in text. Binary differences
   in the PORSCHE.EXE. You also can not play multiplayer if one side has FINAL
   and other side is using myth's BETA. Differences in the car data. This could
   possibly cause problems down the road when updates are released. Screenshots
   have been included so you can see the differences.

   Myth has been taking us all for a ride. First it was Force Commander, with 
   a #!%&ed up release which they've only mildly agree was a screw-up, with
   a bad crack and a bad rip. Later on it was the Imperium Galatica 2 beta
   along with the german files and calling it a final release. And where are
   the speech IG2? Don't expect any. While in past years in the scene,
   this would of been an acceptable practice. But now that the scene is all
   on the net as this is not acceptable anymore since games have gone global.
   If people aren't getting the true English final that they'll be able to
   find in stores it makes it difficult to play multiplayer, and truly enjoy
   the game. The opportunity to release a game with mixed files from betas &
   other language finals has passed by us recently but we'd rather give people
   the game they can expect in stores. That is how you do things proper.

   And where is the music & speech files that Myth knows it could of been
   included in Nascar 2000. Instead of making it PROPER, they rape and release,
   putting out an add-on later on, which in their NFO in the release of NFS5
   BETA they wanted to put an end to with their proposal (Rule 6). They just
   brushed the release under the rug, and move on to the next game likely to
   be #!%&ed up.

   If Myth wants to release games to the scene, they must learn to do things
   proper. They need to make sure that when they release a game that its
   release is a proper rip, truly final or fix their own mistakes. It's best
   they do it right the first time and that we don't have to clean up their
   mistakes every time. Already less than a month old, and we're already
   suspicious about every Myth release. It's like pot luck when Myth release
   is put out. Could it be broken? Maybe beta? Bad Rip? Don't be fooled by an
   imitator.

date%%Sunday--March--19%%
3-19-1~~~MythPC Changes The Rules~~~12:44 PM~~~MythPC's latest release Need For Speed 5 by EA is definitely way over the "Faction's" rule limit. But one must guess that seeing MythPC is not apart of the Faction they don't have to follow nor care about the Faction's rules. So MythPC have made their own more liberal and in my opinion more logical rules which they are going to follow and hope the others will too. But knowing the various groups and their pride, they will probably disregard these rules and stick to the Faction.
<p>
Below are the rules in full.
<p>
<pre>

      NEW RIPRULES

      This ruleset-draft was written in an attempt to restore fair competition
      and at the same time encourage all groups to make the best possible rip.

      Quality AND speed should be the main motives to rip a game.
      
      The BEST rip is the one  that includes ALL the essential gamedata at the
      SMALLEST size in a TIMELY manner  and not necessarily  the one that gets
      released first. 

  1.  The disk  limit  is as of  now  70 x 2,915,000 bytes. This equates  to a
      total  of 204,050,000 bytes of compressed  data. 
      Acceptable   compression formats at this  time are ACE  or RAR, followed
      by the traditional PKZIPing.
      
      The limit for standard game addons is 35 x 2,915,000 bytes. This equates
      to a total of 102,025,000 bytes for the addon. ONLY the group that won a
      rip is  allowed to release addons for it,  as too many times in the past
      addons that were released by third parties did not work.

  2.  Every release  under  this  limit MUST be  a functionally  and  playably
      complete  game.  This  means  that  included  will  be  every  component
      necessary for the successful completion of the game e.g.: 
      
      - all game executables that are needed,
      - every level (single AND multiplayer),
      - every track or course,
      - all actor graphics etc,
      - all registry entries used by a game (for Zone-multiplay etc).
      
      Not necessary to  complete a game are usually manuals, editors etc,  but
      those should stay inside a rip if possible, else released as an addon.

  3.  Any lossless compression method to reduce the size of selected game data
      is ALLOWED (e.g. uharc). 
      
  4.  Lossy compression is ALLOWED for  sound, videos and non-texture graphics
      (e.g. jpeging of menu screens).  Lossy compression of textures is expli-
      citly FORBIDDEN to  prevent the  many  problems inherent to that. 
      
  5.  Sound effects WILL and MUST be included. To reduce the size of rips when
      possible, standard waveformat files (PCM) should be mp3-compressed.   If
      the soundfiles exist inside a bigfile its  highly regarded when time is
      invested to extract those files to compress them.  Groups are not to re-
      quired to index bigfiles though (for further comments read rule 13).
      
      It is allowed to rip music, commentary/speech and ambient sounds as long
      as the game remains playable.  Speech files  MUST be  included if  there
      exist no on-screen subtitles.
      
      If  possible,  ALL sounds and music should be included in a rip  and not
      intentionally as addons. 

  6.  It is ALLOWED  to remove gamedata that exists in multiple resolutions or 
      formats as long as the  game remains playable on a typical system  which
      is defined by a PII-300 with a D3D-card and soundcard.  This means it is
      ALLOWED  to rip the folowing  gamedata as long as it gets released in an
      addon not more than 4 hours after the main rips release:
      
      - low-resolution textures for lowend systems,
      - high-resolution textures for highend systems,
      - high-screenresolution graphics data (above 640x480 or 800x600),
      - hardware-dependent data (e.g. Glide textures).

  7.  Movies (intros, cutscenes) should be removed if they are not game-related
      Movies must be  ripped in a  way so that the  gameplay experience is  not
      compromised, e.g. framing of movies is highly regarded.  It should always
      be avoided  to  create  situations in  which  user-input is  necessary on 
      black screens because the video normally shown has been blacked out.

      When movies/cutscenes  are necessary to understand the game they MUST be
      included in the game.
      
  8.  Other allowed addons for games include:
  
      - cutscenes/movies,
      - commentary/speech,
      - music,
      - manual,
      - editor.
      
      Intro addons are EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN.  Not more than 2 addons should be 
      typically released for a game.

  9.  Children's games (aka  Kiddie  games) and  Edutainment  software  do not
      qualify  under these rules  guidelines for acceptable  releases.  Kiddie
      games are usually definied via the game target audience of  '5-12 years'
      as stated by the game's producer.  Common  sense should  be used by  all
      groups to identify what really is a kiddy game.

 10.  Levelpacks, game addons etc. for rips are only allowed if they are offi-
      cially released/authorized by the  same company/developer/publisher that
      put out the original game. That means e.g. an Age of Empires II addon by
      some lame-o-webstuff company is EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN, while an  addon by
      Microsoft / Ensemble Studios is ALLOWED. Also allowed  would be an addon 
      that was 'officially authorized' by Microsoft/Ensemble.
      
 11.  In regard  to games  distributed  in the  United States  that are  LATER
      distributed in Europe  or vice versa under  the same or different name /
      publisher.  These games  if released  AFTER another group's  release are
      counted  as DUPES  unless  it can  be  proven that  there  is  a clearly
      noticeable  PLAYABLE  difference in the  latter release  (more than just
      tiny differences in graphics or sound). Differences in filedates between
      Euro and US releases are NOT a good enough reason to  rerelease the game
      (example: Supreme Snowboarding and  Boarder Zone are the same game, with
      different Euro/US names and filedates. But as there was no PLAYABLE dif-
      rence in the games, the release of Boarder Zone was a dupe).

 12.  If two or more rips of the same game get released, the first working rip
      wins.  Sites should not nuke any  release until the winning rip has been
      proven to work correctly and follows the above ruleset.
      
 13.  To prevent sloppy rips, a rerelease of a game is  ALLOWED and defined as 
      the winning release if:
      
      a) it can be ripped in >=10 disks less than the previous release by using 
         only lossless compression methods. 

      b) it can be ripped in >=15 disks less or <50% of the size of the previous
         release by using mp3-compression.

      That means all the essential gamedata must be still included in the rere-
      lease. If data gets removed, the rip-nfo must state why that data was not 
      essential to the gameplay.

      The rerelease of a rip must be done in at most 36 hours after the release
      of the original rip, as possibly every game is rippable in a smaller size
      if enough time is spent.
