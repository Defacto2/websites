5-6-1~~~Pirates With Additude Leave With The Future Unknown~~~3:43 PM~~~Pirates with Attitude the longest running and active scene 'util/app' group in existence officially released their final release today.
<p>
PWA had been in existence for eight years now and during many of those years they held a high dominance in their scene. A good number of those where spent being at number one. It's unfortunate too see groups like this go out the way they have, but they took the risks and now they are suffering the consequences. Remember they took the risks for you the users, and now they are paying for it literally with their lives (as they currently know it).

With pain in my heart I have to announce, the death of a very prestigious
 group, who set scenestandards in the period 1992-2000.
 Today, the remaining members of the original PWA council have decided to
 disband the group. The scene has become too dangerous for us to continue, 
 and our advice to current group leaders is to watch your backs very
 closely. With the venue of the internet age, our standards have gone
 downhill, and it doesn't look like we learn lessons from the past.
 The scene is too open for the external world, making life easy for moles
 to enter our ranks. Unfortunately, we had to experience this in a very
 hard way recently.

 Words of gratitude go out to the people who made PWA what it was,
 couriers, suppliers, crackers and siteops you all excelled in what was
 expected from you. Especially I would like to thank all of you for
 the unique comradery experience I was able to witness in my rather
 short membership (4 years). I would also like to thank the pioneers
 of PWA, Orion and his original gang, for creating this group and
 making it a top player. 
 
 A personal remark:
 Congrats Grade, You did it (once more). 

 Sayonara and remember ... If you are going to do it .... Do it with
 an ATTITUDE!

 Shiffie - PWA Council 1996-2000
