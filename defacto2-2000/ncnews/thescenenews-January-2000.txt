1-26-1~~~Dupecheck.com Forsale~~~4:37 PM~~~The domain name <a href="http://www.dupecheck.com">dupecheck.com</a> is now up for sale. While an asking price isn't listed one could assume that the owners would like to at least like to regain some of their expenses back.
<p>
Buying <a href="http://www.dupecheck.com">dupecheck.com</a> would have the advantage of a very establish name but on the down side the name is also known and monitored by the BSA.~~~scenenews@defacto2.net~~~~~~Scenenews~~~

1-23-1~~~CWS Split~~~2:34 PM~~~The Courier Weekly Scorecard has had some deception going on within it for a while now between key organisers of the journal. Today the webmaster of the site at <a href="http://cws.couriers.org">cws.couriers.org/</a> had enough and called it quits. Upon leaving the job Dopestar left a replacement page for the site with an in site into the problems etc. But this has since been replaced with the old but not fully working website.
<p>
<font color=red>Note: The webmaster has since rejoined CWS and claims this story to be inaccurate.</font>~~~scenenews@defacto2.net~~~~~~Scenenews~~~

1-17-1~~~Razor1911.com~~~5:28 PM~~~The Razor 1911 website (razor1911.com) has received another facelift. But this time with a large but nice flash cartoon for the introduction, and as an interesting menu interface. Unfortunately the content of the webpage is exactly the same as it has been for the past few years. But that is maybe because there hasn't been anything new happening in the group for the same amount of time? :)<br>Source: <a href="http://www.razor1911.com">Razor1911.com</a>~~~scenenews@defacto2.net~~~~~~Scenenews~~~~~~

1-3-1~~~TCA is back online~~~3:09 PM~~~Much to the dismay of many, and the delight of others TCA is back. And with the recent events of 1999 they have made the wise move of making the site private. This means that any potential reader wanting to enter the pages must first complete out an application form to become a member. The application form I might add is very simular to those old BBS apps, just without the cool ANSI! Inside though the site is the same old thing, could do with a nice facelift.<br>Source: <a href="http://<blank>.com">The Crazed</a>~~~scenenews@defacto2.net~~~~~~Scenenews~~~~~~
