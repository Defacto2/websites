6-17-2~~~DEVISO is releasing as Razor 1911~~~1:08 AM~~~The Renegade Chemist, who tried unsuccessfully several years ago to kill 
Razor 1911, has taken an interest in obtaining the name. DEVISO is planning 
to kick all Razor 1911 members and rename themselves to Razor 1911. Their 
plan is to release only ISOs and to give all of their rips to Myth. All top 
siteops are in agreement to NUKE any Razor 1911 releases as FAKE until 
further notice. This is a very lame attempt to gain the respect of a scene 
who has had a less than favourable opinion of DEVISO. Razor 1911 has been in 
a very bad state as far as quantity of releases go, but they have been 
working towards restructuring within the group, and many good things are on 
the horizon for them. They have put their REAL supplies on hold until DEV 
decides to give up the fight and either stick it out with their current lame 
reputation or to vanish just like TRC did the last time he got his ass 
kicked. Again, DEVISO is trying to assume the name of Razor 1911, and all of 
their releases should be considered FAKE.<br>Source: <a href="http://www.scenereview.com">SceneReview</a>~~~scenenews@defacto2.net~~~~~~Scenenews~~~~~~
6-17-1~~~Razor 1911 Situation~~~1:04 AM~~~The problems with Razor 1911 has been well known for literally years now, but it has been only very recently that it has reached crisis point and in even less time become very public.
<p>
On the 12th June Razor released an ISO game which in the NFO contained a statement which reads..
<p><i>
There have been many rumoured changes in Razor. We hope now to clear up a few misconceptions.
<p>1.  Deviance has taken over Razor.<br>
This is absolutely not true.  There has been no takeover.<br>
2.  Deviance has merged into Razor<br>
Again, not true.  There has been no such merger.<br>
3.  Razor is on its deathbed.<br>
Most definitely not true.
<p>
What has occurred is that some of the original PC members of the group have returned to Razor 1911, the group we spent so much of our lives building into a legend.
Along with us have come others who are interested in writing a new chapter for the Blade, to provide their skills and energy in an effort to bring Razor 1911 back to the top, where it belongs.
<p>
With the efforts of the "new blood", the "prodigal sons", and those already in the group, you'll see a lot more from Razor 1911 in the coming months.  We are suspending all rip operations in favor of an ISO only program, and will review that policy at a later date. For now, know that Razor 1911 will strive to become the leader in the ISO scene.
<p>
More announcements about the group will be forthcoming in coming days, keep your eyes peeled on our nfo files to keep yourself in the know.

TCA shortly afterwards claimed that 'TRC[dvniso] + butcher[dvniso] + marauder[dvniso], other seniors, and most members have joined Razor 1911' and that 'Razor 1911 is now being run by Butcher, Marauder, The Renegade Chemist, and Brown Sugar'.
<p>
Now according to TCA, The Renegade Chemist (one time leader of Razor in the mid-90's) had ago at a trail leadership for Razor in the last few months and failed.
<p>
Subsequently there has been a sort of coup at the leadership of Razor. It's IRC channels have been taken over by a hired takeover group. Members have been abandoning ship left, right and center. And now there has been a call by some members to ban all future RazorISO releases all together.<br>Source: <a href="http://">Scenenews</a>~~~scenenews@defacto2.net~~~~~~Scenenews~~~~~~
