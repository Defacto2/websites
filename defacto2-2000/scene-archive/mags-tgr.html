The Game Review is probably the scene's oldest publication that is still running. It was originally started as an additional section for Week In Warez Newsletter. While at the time it wasn't called TGR but rather Ionizer's Game Review it still looks very simular to today’s version.<p>
Within a month of IGR initial publication in WWN #4, Ionizer found himself without a magazine to publish his reviews in, so he started his own. On the 5th of November 1995 the first TGR was released, with many people rejoicing. By 1996 the newsletter found itself so popular that electronic magazines such as RCN and Defacto included the newest editions in their emags. Later on they where even colourised in a bid to get more readers. On the 4th of April 1997 we saw the last issue of a continuous weekly review from Ionizer. Unfortunately due to Ionizer's busy schedule TGR is only released on a weekly basis during the summer.
