# Defacto2 website snapshot from 2000

The complete HTML source to the Defacto2 website from 11th July 2000.

This was the final capture of the static HTML version of Defacto2. Future editions would be run off dynamic web applications using a combination of Macromedia ColdFusion and SQL databases to separate the data from the display code.

This code is online as a historical reference and [it can be viewed online](http://defacto2.net/wayback/defacto2-from-2000-july-11/index.html).
