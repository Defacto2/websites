      joint lawsuit against online pirates </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT color=#cccccc face="arial, sans-serif" size=-1><B>REDWOOD CITY, 
      Calif. and FOSTER CITY, Calif.</B>--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- August 6, 
      1999--<BR>Declaring war on a major Internet pirate ring that illegally 
      uploaded, traded and distributed copies of their software, U.S.-based 
      Electronic Arts(tm) (Nasdaq:ERTS), the industry's largest entertainment 
      software publisher, and Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), the 
      company behind the PlayStation(R) game console, the world's best-selling 
      videogame system, recently filed suit against certain alleged members of 
      the ring in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of 
      California. Among other claims, the complaint asserts the defendants 
      infringed the copyrights and trademarks of the two companies through the 
      copying and distribution of software owned by Electronic Arts and SCEA. 
      <P>United States Marshals and lawyers for the companies recently conducted 
      a court-sanctioned seizure and impounded evidence at the location of a 
      participant of the group that calls itself "Paradigm." During the seizure, 
      a computer, hard drives, CDs and other items related to the illegal 
      operation were impounded by the Marshals. The complaint further notes that 
      the seizure, as well as the investigation which preceded it, produced a 
      significant amount of evidence against members of the worldwide ring 
      located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, the 
      Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Russia and other 
      locations. The evidence identified by true name and location dozens of 
      participants in the distribution of pirated software belonging to the 
      companies. 
      <P>While SCEA and Electronic Arts plan to continue the civil case against 
      the pirates, they also continue to cooperate with law enforcement in the 
      United States and will be turning over evidence to authorities in several 
      of the other relevant countries for possible criminal action against the 
      group's members. 
      <P>"Putting an end to software piracy is a top priority for our industry," 
      said Ruth Kennedy, senior vice president and general counsel, Electronic 
      Arts. "Electronic Arts and SCEA believe that the break up of pirate 
      Internet rings like this will be key to our success in combating the 
      rising problem of Internet piracy. This action is part of our ongoing plan 
      to find and prosecute these thieves." 
      <P>"Piracy of packaged entertainment software last year amounted to over 
      US$3.2 billion worldwide for our industry alone. Electronic Arts alone 
      lost more than $400 million. Internet pirate rings like Paradigm 
      contribute to these losses by uploading games where the industrial pirates 
      in places such as Asia or Russia can download them, turn them into copies 
      of packaged goods and rush them to the street -- sometimes even before we 
      get the legitimate goods to market," Kennedy noted. Pre-release or 
      day-of-release software is highly prized by pirate Internet rings, that 
      compete for "points" in the pirate community by being the first to 
      "release" an illegal version of the product, often with copy protection 
      and other content removed. 
      <P>Both companies praised the recently announced criminal "I.P. 
      Initiative" by federal authorities including the Department of Justice, 
      the FBI, and U.S. Customs, which as its goal has increased criminal 
      prosecutions of pirates of intellectual property. 
      <P>According to Riley Russell, vice president of legal and business 
      affairs, Sony Computer Entertainment America, "We will work diligently to 
      ensure that these counterfeiters are fully prosecuted and that others who 
      think Internet piracy and `trading' is acceptable will think again." 
      Russell noted that last year alone, counterfeiting cost SCEA and 
      Electronic Arts losses of several hundreds of millions of dollars around 
      the globe. 
      <P>Other Internet rings besides Paradigm that are also believed to be 
      involved in the pirating of entertainment software include groups calling 
      themselves "Razor 1911," "Class," "Origin," "Hybrid", "Divine", 
      "Fairlight" and others, with members based in the United States and in 
      many other countries around the world. The companies are confident 
      evidence developed in the current case as well as continuing efforts by 
      the entertainment software industry will result in additional civil 
      actions and criminal prosecution of members of these groups in the future.
