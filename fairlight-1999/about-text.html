Fairlight is one of the most well known cracking groups in the world today. It was born in the year 1987 and still it is going strong.
<p>
Releasing only quality game titles has been our hallmark for a very long time. Though for a time we did release some very well received demos for the Commodore Amiga and the Commodore 64. But today releasing games is what Fairlight is all about and what we will continue to be famous for. 
<p>
Fairlight was originally a Swedish group, founded by two Swedish persons Strider & Black Shadow. The group quickly gained numerous members from all over the globe which helped our way up to be the number one cracking group on both the Amiga and C64. The best games from the best companies came from Fairlight.
<p>
Today Fairlight is probably the best PC group around. Throughout our history we have never released a incomplete copy of a game, we only release full complete versions of games. We never became part of the 'rip' scene because Fairlight means quality. Removing parts of a game to match a file size limit is not quality. We only want to give what the people really want, full complete versions of games. This is the main reason why Fairlight never took the option to enter into the 'rip scene'. We see the future and we are there now.
