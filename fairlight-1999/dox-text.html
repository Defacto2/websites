Fairlight Dox has been around for many years now being a sub-division of Fairlight. Fairlight Dox was originally founded to take care of Fairlight's smaller and not so official releases. Documentation for software, update patches, trainers, instructions and covers is just a small example of what Fairlight Dox has released over the years.
