Class has turned French, Corsairs released by Class a few days ago is actually not in English, but French. Well at least part of it is, some people are saying there is a little foul play going on at Class? I say leave the French titles to Fusion.

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="black"><b>Friday 26th March (8:10pm GMT) - #Razor</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Razor 1911 have now set it's once private channel to public mode. It is nice to see that they are allowing the little people to share in their glory. Just don't go asking them for releases or missing disks, that is so annoying.
<p>

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="black"><b>Friday 19th March (12:35pm GMT) - Starwars</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Just to show they are not completely dead, today Razor 1911 released Star Wars: Xwing Alliance by LucasArts. Razor continues their tradition of releasing big one off titles every blue moon. Still at least they usually do it properly unlike some other groups we know out there.
<p>


<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="black"><b>Wednesday 17th March (4:35pm GMT) - Cricket Danger</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
We don't enjoy giving Razor crap but how the hell do they let a CIH virus onto one of their few releases. It is probably the most well known virus in recent years, and it is sitting on the EXE of Australian Cricket Captain. Thankfully there is a fix from Razor and they suggest that you scan your computer if you touched this release. The game strangely enough looks very simular to another Empire game titled International Cricket Captain.

<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Sun Dancer's Paradigm emag DOT is ment to be getting closer to finalisation. It will according to their advert cover the RIP, ISO, Nintendo 64 and Playstation (PSX) scenes. I'm sure too it will have a splash of bias in it to liven things up :).

<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Sunday is the last day for Class's "Design a Clever Graphic for our Install.exe" competition. If you are a budding artist who would like your nick all over Class's releases (like Imperialism 2) then you better hurry up.

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="black"><b>Wednesday 3rd March (4:45pm GMT) - Desperate Razor 1911</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Razor 1911 has been completely desperate for releases recently, and their first relatively big release for the last month shows this. Gex 2: Enter the Gecko, is nothing more then a USA name change for Gex3D with some mirror changes. But what makes it sad is that every other major group passed on this title long before Razor got their hands onto it.

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="black"><b>Tuesday 28th February (2:40pm GMT) - Goofy Origin</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Poor Origin they where too lazy (or forgot) to modify a setting in Resident Evil 2 to turn off their movies. Now for the past week they have been constantly bombard by people asking why their game continuously crashes. Maybe Origin will take more care next time.
<p>

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="black"><b>Tuesday 23rd February (1:20pm GMT) - &copy; Rebels</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Well after years of trying Rebels have received their own internationally recognised copyright. This means any products (specifically software) that Rebels &copy; is legally bound by international copyright laws. Very ironic if I must say.

<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Divine has released the store final of Hardtrucks, Road To Victory from Pride Int. originally released by Reflux nearly 1/2 a year ago. According to Divine ..<br>
"Well, they really outdid themselves with this one! Some close examination showed us that they actually combined the english demo with the russion texture files! Best proof for this is the "uninst.rtf" file in the setup directory. In the Refulx release this reads "Are you going to uninstall your Hard Truck Demo"<br>
Wow, thats even more creative then the ROR (early Reflux) Quake beta to final stunt.

A group titled Bloody Thieves have released a Beta to Final patch for Alpha Centauri. But note this is for the Razor 1911 beta version not the Paradigm final version released days later.

Okay the saga with Sim City 3000 is finally dead. Who won and lost, well contrary to what other sites say Origin did release a beta/non store edition of Simcity 3000.
The fact of the matter is if you go into any gaming retail store (USA, Canada, Australia, etc) and purchase a copy of Simcity 3000 and then once it is loaded you do that Ctrl Alt V (information request) trick. You will a see a line OEM Idenitification sc3final*******.rc2 (as shown in the Class version) depending on which country you buy it in.
So no matter what Origin says, Class did not modify their version reply and Origin's release was not the one that went gold, not the one that is in the stores and thus not the final version.
