  Liath is set in the city of Azeretu, where, for some strange reason, the   ³³
  flow of time is incorrect. Criss, Ithena, and Tiche are long time friends. ³³
  When Tiche moves to Azeretus, Criss and Ithena do not hear from her for a  ³³
  long time. Tiche is unaware of this fact because of the distortion of time ³³
  in Azeretus. Eventually, Criss and Ithena decided to go to Azeretus        :³
  themselves, not knowing that return from Azeretus is impossible. So, the   :³
  story begins with Criss and Ithena in their search for Tiche in the magical ³
  city of Azeretus. During their quest, the quest becomes clear that this is  ³
  not just a simple search to find Tiche, but it involves the fate of the    :³
  magical city itself as well as the fate of the entire world...              ³
                                                                             .³
  Liath is an arcade adventure, this time set in a fairy-tale world. The      ³
  side-on perspective used in this game (Kings Quest / Indiana Jones / Broken ³
  Sword) is combined with a moving camera-effect. Therefore, when the player  ³
  moves off the screen to the left or right, the transition to the next       ³
  screen is realistically depicted by a swooping (not scrolling!) camera, in  ³
  order to create a fully believable game-world. Depicted in 800x600          ³
  resolution and an enormous amount of detail on screen, Liath has to be seen ³
  to be believed.                                                             ³

  The gameplay does not stand in the shadow of graphical trickery, and the    ³
. complexity and originality of the puzzles is perfectly tuned, with puzzles  ³
  becoming more difficult as the player progresses, but with puzzles also     ³
: remainning logical at all times.                                           .³

³ charts.                                                                    ³³

³ JTS News:                                                                  ³³
³ Yes my friends, it is SLAGGING time! This release slag meat is SKILL,      ³³
³ dictator leader of CLASS, and the person who publishes Just The Facts.     ³³
³ SKILL, not content with his crew CLASS ruling the horsy game releasing     ³³
³ scene, has decided to use his ideas in Just The Facts as a propaganda      ³³
³ machine for promoting his group. This would not be so bad. Except he does  ³³
³ not put his name on the charts and claims that they are independent and    ³³
³ objective. So, how do we know he does the charts? Well even his own group  ³³
³ members say so! The code is even coded by, a CLASS member, ATM for SKILL,  ³³
³ as he cannot code himself (LAMER). SKILL is the lamer behind Just The      ³³
³ Facts.                                                                     ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ Now let us examine the propaganda he uses to make his group number #1      ³³
³ month after month in Just The Facts. Last month in December, ORIGIN        ³³
³ released the most awaited major games and many other releases. Yet, we     ³³
³ finished second by some way! We are very surprised by this. So, we decided ³³
³ to look at how these charts are calculated to see if it all added up.      ³³
³ First of all, we are surprised to see the scores given for the games we    ³³
³ released.                                                                  ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ For example, Football Masters 99 got 4.5 points where as Player Manager    ³³
³ 98-99, a similar game, got only 4.0 points. Maybe because Football Masters ³³
³ 99 is a superior game? No, actually it is inferior. A better score would   ³³
³ be Football Masters 99 4.0 points and Player Manager 98-99 5.0 points, but ³³
³ then what would SKILL know about games from LIMEY land. It is so long      ³³
³ since he had any! We also thought the score for Magic and Mayhem is a bit  ³³
³ stingy as well. It deserves at least 8.0 points. Starsiege: Tribes is, of  ³³
³ course, a major and should have got 7.5 points at least, if not more! The  ³³
³ inaccuracies within SKILL's bullshit confounded us more when he managed to ³³
³ forget all about our Thief trainer that we did. This shows the lack of     ³³
³ care for other groups work. Also, the biggest thing that we laughed at is  ³³
³ his minus points for the Gangsters Trainer fix. Well, this makes us laugh  ³³
³ as many trainers get released these days that do not work correctly, if at ³³
³ all, and, at least, we bothered to re-release it. But, that is not why we  ³³
³ laughed. We laughed because it BREAKS his own rules. As it clearly states, ³³
³ points will be deducted for GAME releases, not trainers. In other words,   ³³
³ he cannot keep to his own bullshit. No changes there from SKILL gimp. But, ³³
³ the biggest surprise is our Pinky and The Brain release. We had called the ³³
³ company that made this game and they said themselves that it is Adultware. ³³
³ So, this is obviously a piss-poor attempt at fixing the points so CLASS    ³³
³ can win, as it is the only way they could that month. His fixing even by   ³³
³ his own fucked up rules lost ORIGIN at least 9 points. if not more, that   ³³
³ month. Which would have made ORIGIN the top group for that month, by his   ³³
³ own fucked up rules, of course.                                            ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ Now let us examine the same treatment he applies to his group CLASS.       ³³
³ Biggest surprise is the score for War of the Worlds. It received 8.5       ³³
³ points. Apparently, according to SKILL, this is same as our Thief, which   ³³
³ is voted Innovative Game of the Year 1998 by the TRG readership (Review    ³³
³ scores which he also publishes). Well, we have to say that this game is    ³³
³ is nowhere near as good as Thief; it is not even in the same ballpark. We  ³³
³ would give it the same score as our Rival Realms, a similar game, which    ³³
³ received 7.0 points and that is being fucking generous. Next is Snowmobile ³³
³ Racing, a game with only 4 levels; thus, we give it one point for each     ³³
³ level, unlike his whopping 5 points. The next joke is Top Gun: Hornet's    ³³
³ Nest also from CLASS with 8 points. Well, this game is not regarded as a   ³³
³ major flight sim by anyone except SKILL. Where as our Ultra Fighters       ³³
³ received 7 points; we shall give it the same. When ORIGIN has released     ³³
³ hunting games, SKILL has given them only 3 points, but when CLASS released ³³
³ Trophy Buck, guess what? Yes, it received 5.5 points. Well, now that we    ³³
³ know hunting games are getting full points. We decided to release one this ³³
³ month, and we expect full points like Trophy Buck received for our Natural ³³
³ Fawn Killers release. Not to mention Carnivores, also a hunting game, from ³³
³ CLASS received 6 MASSIVE points. Then, we come to Luftwaffe Commander,     ³³
³ another flight sim, getting 8 points. We shall have to reduce that to the  ³³
³ usual 7 points.                                                            ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ But, the biggest lame fuck up from REDNECK SKILL is giving CLASS points    ³³
³ for their RECOIL trainer and then stating PARADIGM's release is BETA.      ³³
³ Surely this trainer cannot count as it is for the BETA version. As we can  ³³
³ see, it does. Why is this a fuck up? Well, if fixes for trainers get minus ³³
³ points then a re-release for the RECOIL trainer will have to occur for the ³³
³ FINAL version, thus CLASS have lost points for this lame attitude by SKILL ³³
³ GIMP. As they say what goes around comes around. But, ORIGIN will not be   ³³
³ as mean as we believe mistakes happen, so in our view it is not points     ³³
³ gained and no points lost! Thus, CLASS would have had 5 less points as a   ³³
³ result.                                                                    ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ The scores originally presented by SKILLESS came to:                       ³³
³ CLASS         +70.5                                                        ³³

³ PARADIGM      +53.5                                                        ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ With adjusted sensible scores and 20 points deducted for CLASS because of  ³³
³ SKILL's CHEATING lameness at trying to make CLASS #1 every month because   ³³
³ he is the leader, the score now comes to a sensible, realistic score:      ³³
³ ORIGIN         +74.5                                                       ³³
³ PARADIGM       +53.5                                                       ³³
³ CLASS          +45.5                                                       ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ Also, I am sure if PARADIGM and RAZOR checked their releases over the      ³³
³ month/year, they would find SKILL LAMER has fucked them on a regular       ³³
³ basis. Now some may say this is sour grapes by ORIGIN, well, it is not. It ³³
³ seems we are not the only ones who think his charts are REDNECK crap       ³³
³ because even his own friends in CLASS do not rate his poor excuse for      ³³
³ charts. PROZAC has stated he wants to start his own charts. At least, he   ³³
³ has the guts to put his name on them!                                      ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ There will be the usual crap in Just The Facts next month about how SKILL  ³³
³ lamer is not the guy and rubbish like "oh no mon ami it is not poor        ³³
³ Mr. Skill" and so on. But, it is a known fact in the scene that he         ³³
³ publishes that piece of trash, Just The Facts.                             ³³
