  JTS #2 News Flash: Just The Slags: Part Deux!                              ³³
  Read on to see why SKILL & HEMP HOODLUM are lame, and why SKILL is the     ³³
  LAMER behind Just The Facts CLASS charts.                                  ³³
                                                                             ³³

  WORMS: Armageddon will see Worms as we know and love it going out with     ³³
  a bang. It enhances the original award-winning gameplay with barmy new     ³³
  weapons, game-enhancing new features and much improved multi- and          ³³
  single-player gaming modes. We have also set up WORMNET, a                 ³³
  free worldwide IRC-style network to make playing online easier and         ³³
  more accessible.                                                           ³³
  Martyn Brown, development director at Team17 informs, "Worms has such a    ³³
  cult following that even after Worms 2, more ideas and requests for a      ³³
  sequel just kept flooding in. We decided to let the original Worms         ³³
  concept go out all guns blazing with a final, totally over-the-top game    ³³
  incorporating everything that's ever been asked for and more."             ³³
  Is this WORMS finally 3D ?:                                                ³³
  "It's the end as we know it". However, there is no 3D version in           ³³
  development, and will not be until several difficult problems are          ³³
  overcome. We have looked at it for two years and remain unconvinced.       ³³
  I hope it demonstrates our belief in the game that we haven't looked       ³³
  to 'cash in' with a quick and nasty 3D version. But we really think        ³³
  that Worms in the form as it is now, has been stretched as far as it       ³³
  can be with Worms Armageddon.                                              ³³
                                                                              ³

  Yes fellow ELiTES, it is SLAGGING time AGAiN! This time its the turn of     ³
  SKILL dictator leader of CLASS, the person who publishes Just The Facts.   .³
  And HEMP (HUMPADICK) HOODLUM.                                              ³³
  REDNECK SKILL and HUMPADICK claimed in their dupe of SIM CITY 3000 - CLS   ³³
  that ours was BETA. Well the ORIGIN release of SC3K is FINAL and we shall  ³³
  now prove it. Not only we will prove its FINAL but we shall also show how  ³³
  the CLS release is not only a DUPE TWICE, but a RAPE as well. We shall     ³³
  show this by not only our views, but by the FUCKTION rules as well!!!      ³³
  Now HUMPADICK (a SKILLESS lackey) claims his DUPE is FINAL and different   ³³
  and he cracked their version.                                              ³³
  Well we were surprised when we saw this total act of LAMENESS. But we      ³³
  thought we would look at their .exe file to see what the differences were, ³³
  if any. We now hand you over to Light Bringer one of the most talented     ³³
  coders in the scene. He will provide forensic evidence showing that there  ³³
  is no difference between our version and HUMPADICKS, except a few bytes    ³³
  of text which are nothing to do with the game and GAMEPLAY.                ³³
                                                                             ³³

  Whoop CLASS released a "Sim City 3000 Beta to Final Upgrade". Wow what a   ³³
  release! Well I must say I was about to shit in my own hat and wear it,    ³³
  as I promised I would do if ours was beta. What did fortune make me say    ³³
  to myself? Let me check their "Final" before having any shit drip on my    ³³
  head. I did a short "fc /b" (by the way I wonder how many guys in the      ³³
  scene know what fc.exe does; I will explain anyway: fc /b does a byte      ³³
  by byte compare between two files). So I renamed the ORIGIN "sc3.exe"      ³³
  to "sc3.ogn" and the CLASS "sc3.exe" to "sc3.cls", put them in the same    ³³
  dir and typed "fc /b sc3.cls sc3.ogn >output". Let me show you the         ³³
  contents of the "output" file:                                             ³³
                                                                             ³³

  That is a huge difference, isn't it? Well, let me explain what's up with   ³³
  this difference. The first thing at 000000BF, that 55 hex byte, won't do   ³³
  anything to the game since it is in the header. The bytes from 000F8FC8    ³³
  until 000F8FFD... guess what they mean if you "translate" them into        ³³
  ASCII: "The 30 day expiration of this pre-release has expired.". That's    ³³
  nice of them to leave that in the final. Stupid programmers can't do a     ³³
  good cleanup of the final code. We at ORIGIN, removed that from the .exe.  ³³
  I suppose you already know why. We've got hundreds of complaints about     ³³
  the game maybe being a beta. If we would have left that message there,     ³³
  we would have probably got thousands of complaints. On the other side,     ³³
  what if we removed it? The text is not referenced from anywhere in the     ³³
  code. That means that the game does not use the message. If the game       ³³
  programmers are not able to cleanup their code, we at ORIGIN shall do it   ³³
  for them =). (Its called QUALITY class!).                                  ³³
                                                                             ³³
  Now about the last 14 bytes: Here is the version displayed in the ORIGIN   ³³
  release:                                                                   ³³
  "SC3KBeta102991.1";                                                        ³³
  and here is the version displayed in the CLASS "final":                    ³³
  "SC3final1230981.rc2".                                                     ³³
                                                                             ³³
  The first thing that pops up in my eyes is that the ORiGiN release has     ³³
  the last three compared bytes 0. Why is that? If I look at the strings,    ³³
  the CLASS one is 3 bytes longer. What a coincidence. Did I just say 14     ³³
  bytes? Well the strings are actually longer than 14 bytes. How is this?    ³³
  The CLASS version string is 19 characters long and the ORIGIN one is only  ³³
  16 characters long. Well those characters are only the difference,         ³³
  notice the offsets. Look at this:                                          ³³
                                                                             ³³

  Now I think it's obvious. The huge difference between the CLASS "final"    ³³
  and the ORIGIN "TRUE FINAL" is that the "final" has the pre-release        ³³
  message and a different version. Now for this difference CLASS released    ³³
  a DUPE. Yes, a DUPE. What the heck? I do not say that CLASS modified the   ³³
  version string, nor do I say that they used our crack, I just say that     ³³
  if I took 10-15 minutes of my time I could modify that version string to   ³³
  say "CLASS.sux0rs". Actually, if you know what ASCII is and know how to    ³³
  add and subtract, you can write "CLASS.sux0rs" yourself in your own copy   ³³
  of Sim City 3000.                                                          ³³
  Well, after comparing the files I tried to use QuickView on both the       ³³
  .exe files. Guess what I found:                                            ³³
  "Time Date Stamp: 36898d1a" was in both .exe files. Nice. I keep           ³³
  wondering what that means ;)                                               ³³
  As a final note I hope i did not "mutilate" the English language too       ³³
  badly.                                                                     ³³
  And I assume that if CLASS expects problems with anything in the ORiGiN    ³³
  release, they should expect the same problems with their release.          ³³
  Could it be that they are newbies and don't know how to use "fc.exe".      ³³
  But I can't know this and I am almost sure there are a few people in       ³³
  CLASS that do know the way it works and also know what fair play is.       ³³
                                                                             ³³

                                                                             ³³
  As we can see there is no difference at all GAMEPLAY wise. The only        ³³
  difference is a few strings which are not used within the game at all!     ³³
  However we decided to go back to the cracker of this fine game to see      ³³
  what he had to say about the CLS dupe.                                     ³³
                                                                             ³³
  ------- Evidence From: Merlijn (DVNISO) ---------------                    ³³
                                                                             ³³
  As anyone, I was curious about the "store final" release of SC3K. I        ³³
  downloaded the "beta to final" update and compared it to our version.      ³³
  I noticed some differences:                                                ³³
  -  We removed the "prerelease, beta" text to avoid ragging and shit.       ³³
  This text was present in the class release.                                ³³
  But most important: the code segment was identical!!!! This means that     ³³
  the actual program was identical to our version. This is something         ³³
  I did not expect! In this code segment, I patched 3 bytes to do the        ³³
  cd-check thingy. The class version had the exact same 3 byte patches.      ³³
  This is kind of unexpected as I do something with the "getdrivetypea"      ³³
  windows API that few other people do:                                      ³³
  Original code:                                                             ³³
  call     GetDriveTypeA                                                     ³³
  cmp      eax,05        (05 means cd-drive)    jnz      offsetMy crack:     ³³
  call     GetDriveTypeA    cmp    eax,03        (03 means harddisk)         ³³
  jnz      offset                                                            ³³
                                                                             ³³
  It's possible they came up with the same solution, but it's unlikely. I    ³³
  remember that the 2 other byte patches where somewhat unregular too. But   ³³
  class had the same patches here 2.                                         ³³
  My guess is that they are full of shit. I don't really care if they        ³³
  (ab)use my crack, but the fact that they have must mean only one thing:    ³³
  they knew the exe's where identical!                                       ³³
  Another remark about the size of their release. They shrunk it to 50       ³³
  disks. As you can remember, we could have done the same but decided not    ³³
  too. The only way this game comes below 50 disks, is if you fuck around    ³³
  with the quality of the sound or remove some of the sfx. I'm curious       ³³
  what class did. Whatever it was, it is probably in violation of their      ³³
  own fucktion rules. How lame can you get? What has happened with Class     ³³
  and their quality?                                                         ³³
                                                                             ³³
             Merlijn                                                         ³³
                                                                             ³³
  ------- Evidence From: Merlijn (DVNISO) ---------------                    ³³
                                                                             ³³
  As you can see not only is the GAME the same but the CRACK is the same as  ³³
  well! We are not going to say they STOLE our crack as we can never know    ³³
  for sure. But one thing is for sure and that is HUMPADICK the cracker of   ³³
  the CLS DUPE, has not been known for his cracking skills. Where as Merlijn ³³
  is KNOWN throughout the scene as being one of the best crackers around     ³³
  and equal to almost anyone else.                                           ³³
  Also more evidence comes in the fact that one top scene group did an IND   ³³
  release at 50 discs and stated that the ORIGIN version was indeed FINAL.   ³³
  So you see not only did CLASS DUPE once but they also DUPED the IND which  ³³
  we consider a RAPE as SFX sound is missing from it. Thus the CLS DUPE is   ³³
  in fact a DOUBLE-DUPE and a RAPE as well!                                  ³³
                                                                             ³³
  Now the evidence that is presented here is from ORiGiN members, we admit   ³³
  this totally up front. But we have also shown how other crackers, from     ³³
  other groups can check this for themselevs. So you see we are not trying   ³³
  to HIDE anything, unlike CLS who are trying to HIDE everything! But to     ³³
  prove this beyond a doubt we shall refer you to the FUCKTION rules, rules  ³³
  which SKILL and CLASS profess to abide by.                                 ³³
                                                                             ³³
   Rule 8 is the rule we shall examine first:                                ³³
 8.In regard  to games  distributed  in the  United States  that are  LATER  ³³
   distributed in Europe  or vice versa under  the same or different name /  ³³
   publisher.  These games  if released  AFTER another group's  release are  ³³
   counted  as DUPES  unless  it can  be  proven that  there  is  a clearly  ³³
   noticeable PLAYABLE  difference in the  latter release (eg. new  levels,  ³³
   enhanced graphics, or other new features).                                ³³
                                                                             ³³
   As you can see it clearly says PLAYABLE difference. Something the CLS     ³³
   DDR (DOUBLE-DUPE RAPE) does not have. There are no PLAYABLE differences.  ³³
   So, as you can see the CLS version is a DUPE. But now let us look at      ³³
   rule 3 from the FUCKTION rules co-developed by SKILLESS.                  ³³
   3.  Sound effects WILL and MUST be included.                              ³³
                                                                             ³³
   Well CLS ripped out loadsa SFX sound in order to RAPE the DDR version to  ³³
   the 50 disc FUCKTION limit, thus this is what is known as a RAPE.         ³³
   So as you can see the USA leadership of class, SKILLESS and HUMPADICK     ³³
   have no morals about DUPEING and DOUBLE DUPEING and RAPING other groups   ³³
   QUALITY releases. In fact CLS were actually finalised this month on one   ³³
   of their releases so, it is they who should be accused of releasing BETAS ³³
   if anyone should be! CLASS have many cool members, like CATMAN for        ³³
   who suggested we should look into the CLS dupe this way. But the          ³³
   leader, SKILL dictates the group policy and his bum chum HUMPADICK        ³³
   helps to keep the propaganda going, when SKILLESS has no GUTS to come     ³³
   speak for himself. It is not surprising that no CLS cracker, that usually ³³
   cracks for CLS, cracked this DDR. Maybe that was because none wanted to   ³³
   be involved with such LAMENESS. But if these people continue to stay in   ³³
   CLS then they will have to accept that the LAMENESS of SKILL and HUMPADICK³³
   will tarnish them as well. And it is for these people that we feel        ³³
   truly sorry.                                                              ³³
   But the biggest LAMENESS of this whole situation is that the scene had to ³³
   suffer endless debate about the status of our SC3K FINAL. This cannot be  ³³
   put down to ORIGIN, as we did claim within the NFO that this was the FINAL³³
   version and indeed at the same time a senior class frog said the same.    ³³
   Also DDR files filled the many sites with crap and lameness from class.   ³³
   This also trickled over into the ISO seen where an old name was ruined by ³³
   HUMPADICK as well.                                                        ³³
   It is often claimed that ORIGIN starts trouble. Well this is not true,    ³³
   we actually avoid it. But if attacked we shall always defend ourselves    ³³
   against the LAMENESS of the scene. And we shall always, yes always        ³³
   FINSIH IT!                                                                ³³
                                                                             ³³
                                                                             ³³
  Now back to SKILLESS and his LAME JTF charts. ATM the coder of JTF has     ³³
  claimed that SKILL only collects the NFOS for JTF and that someone else    ³³
  types the fiction. Well we think ATM has been lied to by SKILLESS. And as  ³³
  per usual we shall prove it! A recent chat between CYPHER and HUMPADICK    ³³
  in a public channel on IRC was as follows:                                 ³³
                                                                             ³³
  <hrmph> skill gives you points out of pitty  <<< Spelling HUMP!            ³³
  <CYPHER> Hump: So you admit SKILL does the charts :)                       ³³
  <hrmph> did i ever NOT admit it?                                           ³³
                                                                             ³³
  As you can see the admission by the personal bum chum of SKILL and the     ³³
  arrogance in which the charts are run, 'pitty'. Shows that the REDNECK     ³³
  SKILLLAME does indeed do the charts, and lies to others that he does not!  ³³
  For those who missed the previous facts about JTF we present them once     ³³
  again for your enjoyment!                                                  ³³
                                                                             ³³
  SKILL, not content with his crew CLASS ruling the horsy game releasing      ³
  scene, has decided to use his ideas in Just The Facts as a propaganda      .³
  device for promoting his group. This would not be so bad. Except he does    ³
  not put his name on the charts, and he claims that they are independent     ³
  and objective. How do we know he does the charts? Well even his own group   ³
  members say so! The code is even coded by, a CLASS member, ATM for SKILL,   ³
  as he cannot code himself (LAMER). SKILL is the LAMER behind Just The       ³
  Facts.                                                                      ³
                                                                             .³
  Now let us examine the propaganda he uses to make his group number #1       ³
  month after month in Just The Facts. Last month in December, ORIGIN         ³
  released the most awaited major games and many other releases. Yet, we     .³
  finished second by some way! We are very surprised by this. So, we decided .³
  to look at how these charts are calculated to see if it all added up.      :³
  First of all, we are surprised to see the scores given for the games we    :³
  released.                                                                  :³
                                                                             ³³
  For example, Football Masters 99 got 4.5 points where as Player Manager    ³³
  98-99, a similar game, got only 4.0 points. Maybe because Football Masters ³³
  99 is a superior game? No, actually it is inferior. A better score would   ³³
  be Football Masters 99 4.0 points and Player Manager 98-99 5.0 points, but ³³
  then what would SKILL know about games from LIMEY land. It is so long      ³³
  since he had any! We also thought the score for Magic and Mayhem is a bit  ³³
  stingy as well; it deserves at least 8.0 points. Starsiege: Tribes is a    ³³
. major release, and it should get 7.5 points at least, if not more! The     ³³
. inaccuracies within SKILL's bullshit confounded us more when he managed to ³³
  forget all about our Thief trainer that we did. This shows the lack of     ³³
. care for other groups' work. Also, the biggest thing that we laughed at is ³³
  his minus points for the Gangsters Trainer fix. Well, this makes us laugh  ³³
  as many trainers get released these days that do not work correctly, if at ³³
  all, and, at least, we bothered to re-release it. But, that is not why we  ³³
. laughed. We laughed because it BREAKS his own rules. As it clearly states, ³³
  points will be deducted for GAME releases, not TRAINERS. In other words,   ³³
  he cannot keep to his own bullshit. No changes there from SKILL GIMP. But, ³³
  the biggest surprise is our Pinky and The Brain release. We had called the ³³
  company that made this game, and they said themselves that it is           ³³
. Adultware. So, this is obviously a piss-poor attempt at fixing the points  ³³
  so CLASS can win, as it is the only way they could that month. His fixing  ³³
  even by his own fucked up rules lost ORIGIN at least 9 points, if not      ³³
: more, that month. Which would have made ORIGIN the top group for that      ³³
: month by his own fucked up rules, of course.                               ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ Now let us examine the same treatment he applies to his group CLASS.       ³³
³ Biggest surprise is the score for War of the Worlds; it received 8.5       ³³
³ points. Apparently, according to SKILL, this is same as our Thief, which   ³³
³ is voted Innovative Game of the Year 1998 by the TRG readership (review    ³³
³ scores which he also publishes). Well, we have to say that this game is    ³³
³ nowhere near as good as Thief; it is not even in the same ballpark. We     ³³
³ would give it the same score as our Rival Realms, a similar game, which    ³³
³ received 7.0 points and that is being fucking generous. Next is Snowmobile ³³
³ Racing, a game with only 4 levels; thus, we give it one point for each     ³³
³ level, unlike his whopping 5.0 points. The next joke is Top Gun: Hornet's  ³³
³ Nest also from CLASS with 8.0 points. Well, this game is not regarded as a ³³
³ major flight sim by anyone except SKILL. Our Ultra Fighters received 7.0   ³³
³ points; we shall give Top Gun the same score. When ORIGIN had released     ³³
³ hunting games, SKILL gave those titles only 3.0 points. CLASS had released ³³
³ Trophy Buck; it received 5.5 points. Well, now that we know hunting games  ³³
³ are getting full points. We decided to release one hunting title this      ³³
³ month, and we expect full points for our Natural Fawn Killers release,     ³³
³ like Trophy Buck did. Not to mention Carnivores, also a hunting game, from ³³
³ CLASS received 6.0 MASSIVE points. Then, we come to Luftwaffe Commander,   ³³
³ another flight sim, getting 8.0 points. We shall have to reduce that to    ³³
³ the usual 7.0 points. In sum, CLASS's unfamiliar, subpar titles received   ³³
³ more points than ORIGIN's anticipated, hit titles.                         ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ But, the biggest lame fuck up from REDNECK SKILL is giving CLASS points    ³³
³ for their RECOIL trainer, and, then, stating PARADIGM's release is BETA.   ³³
³ Surely, this trainer cannot count as it is for the BETA version. As we can ³³
³ see, it does. Why is this a fuck up? Well, if fixes for trainers get minus ³³
³ points then a re-release for the RECOIL trainer will have to occur for the ³³
³ FINAL version, thus CLASS have lost points for this lame attitude by SKILL ³³
³ GIMP. As they say, what goes around comes around. But, ORIGIN will not be  ³³
³ as mean as we believe mistakes happen, so in our view it is no points      ³³
³ gained and no points lost! Thus, CLASS would have had 5 less points as a   ³³
³ result.                                                                    ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ The scores originally presented by SKILLESS came to:                       ³³
³ CLASS        +70.5                                                         ³³
³ ORIGIN       +65.5                                                         ³³
³ PARADIGM     +53.5                                                         ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ With adjusted sensible scores and 20 points deducted for CLASS because of  ³³
³ SKILL's CHEATING lameness at trying to make CLASS #1 every month because   ³³
³ he is the leader, the score now comes to a sensible, realistic score:      ³³
³ ORIGIN       +74.5                                                         ³³
³ PARADIGM     +53.5                                                         ³³
³ CLASS        +45.5                                                         ³³
³                                                                            ³³
³ Also, I am sure if PARADIGM and RAZOR checked their releases over the      ³³
³ month/year, they would find SKILL LAMER has fucked them on a regular       ³³
³ basis. Now some may say this is sour grapes by ORIGIN. Well, it is not. It ³³
³ seems we are not the only ones who think his charts are REDNECK crap       ³³
³ because even his own friends in CLASS do not rate his poor excuse for      ³³
