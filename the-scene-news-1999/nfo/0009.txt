º±³ members yesterday. I got it today and made some nfo-adjustments to it  ³

º±³ Apparently everyone's version of the real story has been blindfully    ³
º±³ neglected.  For all you 'scene' people out there as well as CORE and   ³
º±³ DSi both OF YOUR STORIES ARE NOT TRUE!                                 ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ You've blamed the wrong person and ALM is totally pissed at everything ³
º±³ and blames me for it all, which he is justified in doing.........      ³
º±³ I'm coming out to you clean, my name is Mike, and WAS a friend of      ³
º±³ ALM's, I met him in my C++ class awhile ago.  We live in the same      ³
º±³ city and had a close friendship, however now its all lost mainly       ³
º±³ because of my stupid careless actions.  I only ripped cause it was     ³
º±³ easier and quicker to do.  =[                                          ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ I'm the one who made all those keygens as well as a few others it was  ³
º±³ NOT ALM_DeTh's doing.   I know nothing about 'the scene', im not a     ³
º±³ part of it.  I gave ALM those keygens cause he use to reward me by     ³
º±³ giving me some cool games & utils that i needed, however i didnt code  ³
º±³ them by myself, i used CORE's old keygens.  I encrypted them so that   ³
º±³ nobody would figure out, but i guess i was wrong.  Im the LAME one     ³
º±³ not ALM or DSi!   ALM has never told anyone about me because im not in ³
º±³ the scene and he didnt mind having the credit for a few keygens as     ³
º±³ well.  ALM is not a stealer, he knows shitload more then me in many    ³
º±³ things, including coding in ASM.  You guys were careless to point      ³
º±³ fingers at ALM without even knowing the truth!!!                       ³
º±³ ALM retired from DSi days before this entire incident, and DO YOU      ³
º±³ KNOW WHY??? because he was upset with the organization as well as      ³
º±³ efforts that everyone was producing.  He left because he was upset     ³
º±³ that only a few members were putting there effort into cracking and    ³
º±³ helping the group.  You guys should have known that something was      ³
º±³ not right, thanks to this whole saga ALM fucked me over!!!!            ³
º±³ I LOST MY DAMN ISP Account !!!! :(                                     ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ Well i should not have done what ive done, but shit i dont know        ³
º±³ why my ISP account dont work, i can see its not a good idea to fuck    ³
º±³ with ALM.... bleh.... GET THE STORY STRAIGHTENED OUT!                  ³
º±³ ALM/DSi had nothing to do with my shit that i released, i simply gave  ³
º±³ ALM the keygens and he gave it to DSi to release, he never coded them  ³
º±³ i'm sure DSi as well as others know that ALM knows ASM! but since      ³
º±³ ALM retired days ago, he learned about this incident and felt fucked   ³
º±³ because everyone blamed him for shit that he didnt do!!!!              ³
º±³ I'm telling you what really happened and i dont think DSi or ALM should³
º±³ be blamed for releasing stuff that they didnt code for themselves.     ³
º±³ I'm not even a damn member nor even use IRC, i got a call from ALM the ³
º±³ other day and he told me what happened before you know it my ISP kicked³
º±³ me off, and im begging forgiveness !!!  Even tho i doubt i will ever   ³
º±³ gain the friendship of ALM again i beg you please restore and fix      ³
º±³ what was done and don't give ALM or DSi a bad name for My wrong doings.³
º±³ I'm scared of what the heck ALM's gonna do to me, so that is why i     ³
º±³ typed up this little letter and coming out clean with everyone.        ³
º±³ Im gonna give this letter to ALM to release which will be my last      ³
º±³ thing that i will do.                                                  ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ Thank you for your time, and please restore justice and help one       ³
º±³ another.   CORE im very amazed at what you have done, i wish i was     ³
º±³ part of some group or organization that puts effort and stives for     ³
º±³ justice and keeping everything clean, even tho my words are probably   ³
º±³ worthless to you, i'm not a scene person or know anything that goes on ³
º±³ but when my damn ISP dropped me that's when i knew this is serious shit³
º±³ I'm sorry for my wrong doings, but please give ALM & DSi their respect ³
º±³ ALM only tried to help the team, but unfortunately i failed him :(     ³
º±³                                                                        ³

º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ I read what Mike wrote and its the truth.                              ³
º±³ But...                                                                 ³
º±³ GOD DAMN, i fucking retired cause people were not giving all there     ³
º±³ effort in for DSi and could have done more and jesus, few days later   ³
º±³ this whole CORE ordeal happens!@#!!......                              ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ Well for 1 thing, im fucking ashamed to have known that fuckface Mike! ³
º±³ But im rather disappointed about the whole ordeal on both sides, DSi   ³
º±³ as well as CORE.  Is it that easy to blame shit on an innocent person? ³
º±³ Im sure CORE and ESPECIALLY DSI knows that i fucking know ASM!!!!!!!   ³
º±³ My god, you thought a person such as myself is capable of fucking      ³
º±³ ripping other peoples work!?                                           ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ GeSSShhh.  ask anyone in DSi or yet a third party (the famous Zip and  ³
º±³ CindyG) i fucking program in ASM!! They've helped me out in coding     ³
º±³ full programs as well as ignoramous of DSi.  Im sure even Sirax of CORE³
º±³ knows i fucking know ASM, geeeeshhh.                                   ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ You think i would be that stupid and rip with having same offsets which³
º±³ means 100% ripped!?  Takes no genious to know that its impossible to   ³
º±³ replicate the same EXACT offset for those keygens.                     ³
º±³ If i wanted to fucking rip you wouldnt know if i did or didnt cause i  ³
º±³ would just fucking use the algorithm and make my own keygen which i    ³
º±³ could compile and would have different OFFSETs and different layout    ³
º±³ entirely.  duh duh!!!!!  Im pretty sure a few crackers out there who   ³
º±³ know ASM have ripped other peoples work but nobody can prove it cause  ³
º±³ they just totally covered it up.   BAHHHHH!                            ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ CORE u know DSi is a good group and has supported your views against   ³
º±³ other groups ex. WARP.  DSi has nothing to do with those keygens nor do³
º±³ i really, i admit i was given them as well as worked on a very close   ³
º±³ relationship calling Mike up almost on a daily basis, i thought he was ³
º±³ legit :/                                                               ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ Well please get the story straighted out, CORE i truely admire you guys³
º±³ for being so dedicated and going threw all the troubles of checking out³
º±³ the keygens.  But please dont blame DSi for Mike's Shit!!              ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ Im sorry for knowing this fuckhead, but im partially to blame however  ³
º±³ i dont have time to examine old CORE keygens compare them to his etc.  ³
º±³ That is another reason why i retired is because DSi was taking alot of ³
º±³ my time and has interfered with my school work and life.               ³
º±³ Sting and other ppl from DSi know that is true.                        ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ I let Mike fucking give me his crap that he wrote for only 1 reason,   ³
º±³ which is to get the truth out and clear my name as well as DSi's.      ³
º±³ I dont want bullshit being said about me that isnt the truth, i get    ³
º±³ pissed fast because i put alot of effort into DSi and time to make it  ³
º±³ a good group and for 1 fuckface to destroy it all especially only days ³
º±³ after i retired from DSi and this whole saga was revealed is fucked up.³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ Please forgive DSi, i already fucked with this shithead personally and ³
º±³ might screw him over more for what he's done to my reputation as well  ³
º±³ as DSi's. Please clear the wrong doings that has been brought upon the ³
º±³ scene, and CORE you guys are truely 1 of a kind, keep up the damn good ³
º±³ work, i wish DSi had the strong crew like yours to do all the research ³
º±³ you guys do.                                                           ³
º±³                                                                        ³
º±³ I could go threw tons of logs to bring in evidence to prove everything ³
º±³ that i have said, ppl know i dont have much time, and ppl know im      ³
º±³ dedicated and ppl know that i try my best, and ppl know i know ASM!    ³
º±³ I founded DSi on the same basis that CORE did, we are a good group     ³
º±³ despite this ordeal we rls geniune cracks & keygens u know it, and i   ³
º±³ know it, please dont destroy an innocent group.                        ³
