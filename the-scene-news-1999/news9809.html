<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Class have re-released Return Fire 2 *STORE FINAL* (c) RipCord Games after they realised that the original version they released was infact a beta. 
</font><p>
<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>Saturday 19th September (8:15pm GMT) - Warrior Spends 3 Weeks On A Release</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Warrior today released X-Files by Fox Interactive at a whooping 76*28.8 disks (219mb). Now this has been in the shops for many weeks, months in fact, so obviously it has been passed by every other group out there. So how did Warrior manage to convert a 7 CD title to 220mbs while only ripping out the music? (Hint: Even with a music add-on the Warrior edition of X-Files will be inferior to the store version.)
<p>
[NFO BEGIN]<br>
Ok...first of all, I know that this release is above the disk limit and    
that some people will probably nuke it for this reason. In my opinion,     
the size doesn't really matters...the most important things are :          
1) Is the game good? and 2) Does it work?                                  
Well, the answer is : 1) YES , 2) YES.                                     
<p>
Now, about the size of the release. If people have the choice between,     
lets's say, a) a kick ass ACTION game - 80 disks ; b) a great RPG - 100    
disks ; c) a lame FISHING game - 40 disks. Which one(s) do u think they    
will download?                                                             
<p>
The problem is that some people doesn't seem to realize that we're in 1998 
and that the game companies aren't doin' small PacMan games anymore... As  
a result, a lot of good games aren't released on the scene or they are     
completely raped. Just a few examples:                                     
<p>
* Motocross Madness - 71 disks. Good, it's under the disk limit...only     
  one problem : u need to download an extra 40 disks to access the         
  National Track. Total : 111 disks for the game only (without the movies)<br>
* Mech Commander - 90 disks. Above the limit, and u have no sound, no      
  music and no movies...u can't even use the zoom function. Minimum size   
  to make the game "playable" (that is, with the sfx and the zoom addons): 
  241 disks.<br>
* Tiger Woods Golf 99 - 65 disks. This one was a total rape : u only have  
  a few courses, u have no speech, no movies and no animations. Minimum    
  size to make the game "playable" : 162 disks (game + missing courses)    
<p>
I could give u a lot of other exemples like that, but this is not the      
point. The point is that I DON'T THINK THAT A FEW "EXTRA DISKS" MAKES A    
BIG DIFFERENCE and that most of the people are ready to download them if   
they are sure that what they will get is a FULLY PLAYABLE GAME and not a   
rape (UNREAL was 60 x 2.8 Megs...and nobody complained about the size).    
That doesn't mean that we should remove the limit (if people want the      
full game, they can download the ISO or even buy it), but THE SIZE OF A    
RELEASE should only be one of the criterion and not the ONLY criterion to  
decide if a game can be released or not.                                   
<p>
Ok...enough "general comments" and back to this release. As I said above,  
the game is 7 CD's and everything is included here (MUSIC excepted). What  
kind of miracle is this? Well, the answer is : a lot of work (3 weeks)     
and some great video & gfx tools (Adobe Premiere and Photoshop). By        
reducing the frame rate, increasing the compression,... i've been able to  
bring this game to its actual size. If u're interested in numbers, this    
represents a total of 1,627 files (1,254 movies / 309 animated backgrounds 
and 64 moving icons/logos). As a result, the initial size for these files  
(3 Gigs, more or less) is now...200 Megs.                                  
<p>
Was it worth spending all this time on just one game? Well, i think so...  
First, the X-FILES is by far one of the most popular TV show and I think   
that all the fans will enjoy the game. Second, even if u don't watch the   
show on TV, this game is certainly one of the best adventure game ever     
made - the story is great, u have a mix of puzzles to solve / action parts 
and, last, the game isn't linear...u have several different endings and    
your actions have a direct effect on the story...which means, u can play   
it several times with a different story each time.                         
Ok, enough talk...until next nfo, of course :)                             
<br>[NFO END]
<p>
I think the most obvious solution would be for the gaming scene to abolish disk limits and opt instead to set out guide lines on how to rip (and not rape) games. These guide lines would obviously need to be followed and implemented by the game groups and would include what not to include in a release etc.

<p><font face="arial" size="2">
The Marburg virus has infected a few computer magazine CD cover disks recently and of more consern was also discovered on the gold disk of Electronic Art's Wargames. This virus was designed for Windows 95/98/NT which infects your .exe and screen savers. In Wargames the virus is triggered if you use the online registration. This information may consern users of the ripped version, though I doubt any of you registered it or even if it was included in the rip. As usual McAfee and Norton did not at the time of the outbrake detect this virus but VET and AVP did.

The "It seems Paradigm is acting like Microsoft. The pretended that there was nothing wrong with their version of Need For Speed 3 …" news article contains some misleading information.

All the blame should be given to Electronic Arts for reasons that wont be gone into.

It's sad too see just low some groups will go to get some site credits and their names heard. Take this release from Hummber for example, Street Fighter Seriers (c) CAPCOM CO., Ltd.
At first look one assumes its a new release (if you ignore the spelling mistake in the title) from Capcom but its when you read the NFO you find out that its just a dupe of some 5-10 year old games. 
Here is how they justify their pathetic attempt at a release ..<br>

8 Included here is the THE classic game of Street Fighter.  As many     8
8 people have seen the game Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo and up on PC,  8
8 few have seen the ORIGINAL Street Fighter or Street Fighter 2 on PC.  8
8 So here we are, with a CLASSIC release for the curiosity of those who 8

"There were no signs of any struggle or other indications of anything other than a suicide," Sgt. Alan Raynis said.

Reflux has stuffed up another release this time it is X-Plane (c) LAMINAR RESEARCH (which is a technically a simulator rather then a game).

ATN (ACTIVATION) CLOSES IN DISASTREROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
(4th September 1998)

This is Jinponius - ATN Founder / Prez / Trader

As many of you are aware, there were world-wide porn busts.  Unknown to anyone
in ATN, the ATN WHQ siteop has been caught and charged with possession and
distribution child pornography and is due to begin trial in 30 days.  He is 
also likely to face mass piracy charges too, as police also took almost a
terrabyte of pirated software from his apartment.  This letter to everyone
is intended to inform and warn you of the consequences of the events in the
past 28 hours.

Early morning Sept 2 1998, in response to electronic surveillance by the US FBI,
US Customs Dept, and the US Treasury (apparently responsible for more than
banks) sent 15 armed agents to the HOME of Carabus in Connecticut, USA. They
seized his computer, some 1500 cds containing masses of software and also illegal porn.
This raid was one of many made at the same time around the world and in many countries
breaking a world wide porn ring called the WonderLand Club.  How Carabus was brought
to the attention of law enforcement agencies is a question unanswered.  Carabus
was told he had been "screened" by law enforcement agencies, where they had monitored
his two Carabus@ email addresses and his ICQ.  He was shown print outs of his recent
email - so much for privacy on Hotmail.

Carabus was released not long after the raid, because the contents of the PC and
the CDs need to be examined with a fine comb before any arrest is made.  The next
move of Carabus was to go to work later in the morning, give a brief note to the
#ATN98 channel via his bot that he had been busted, and immediately close down his bots.
He then proceeded to destroy his server - CP ATN WHQ, which was untouched due to a
search warrant being unattainable - protected by the University that hosted it.
30mins later Carabus appeared on IRC, and messaged myself.  He told be that he is in
trouble, that he had been raided for software piracy. He DID NOT bother to tell me
that he was raided for child porn.  He also said there is going to be a trial, and that
it is likely he will be deported back to Germany, and lose his job.  He is also likely
to face a big fine and/or imprisonment.  He warned me that they have all information
relating to the existence and activities of ATN, and I was told to go in to hiding on
IRC, change site IPs ports etc etc.  When asked how clued up on warez and the scene
are these authorities, the reply was that they are well educated on the matter.

Since Cara was a senior in ATN, he had access to the ATN MS EXCEL ADMINISTRATION FILE.
This file was sitting on the HDD of the computer that was seized.
This file contained member info such as Nick, Country, ICQ UIN, LOGIN, PASS, IDENT,
IPs (some static ???.???.???.?? and some dynamic), and also showed what sites each
member was on.  On another Tab in the excel file was a sitelist, giving information
such as site name, abbreviation, IP, PORT, Location, Speed, and channel.
This file was protected by a password, which I have no doubt is nothing more than
a formality for opening, since the FBI had even been cracking the "Russian encryption
of porn" that we have heard on the news.  There we must assume that the FBI and
other law enforcement agencies will not only have the static IPs of some very
upset people, but also the IPs of many scene sites.  The following is a list of
scene sites listed in the ADMIN FILE:

5th Element
AF1
BBRO	* ATN INTERNAL SITE
CP	* ATN INTERNAL SITE - WHQ
Cemetary Gates
CNE	* ATN INTERNAL SITE
COD
CPD	* ATN INTERNAL SITE
CPD2	* ATN INTERNAL SITE
EMF	* BOOKWARE SITE
FRAG	* OLD IP B4 IT WAS BUSTED

TB - The Labrynth
TDR
TT
TH - RTS WHQ
TUK -The Ultimate Kingdom
TWL
TWH
VXS	* ATN INTERNAL SITE
VF
WOC
WTC

I urge all siteops to take action - either close down or change access details.
Only (2) of the forementioned sites (SAD AF1) are not located in the countries
where the raids took place.  This does not mean authorities will not act in Hungary
upon request of the authorities from other countries.  I applaude the AF1 siteop for
taking prompt action before there was even confirmation of the exact situation.

The authorities have all Carabus' IRC logs, ICQ message, email messages, and many
IPs of sites and the account details of 70 or so ATN members.  This is cause for
extreme alarm considering every file will be screened on his PC by experts.
Carabus is facing piracy and pornography charges, therefore it is reasonable to assume
not only porn activity is being clamped down, but that the authorities are likely
to take this opportunity to take down the scene sites.  

If the authorities fail to recognise these sites as significant top sites, then it is
reasonable to assume that these sites listed in the ADMIN file could be deemed to be
distributing illegal pornography by authorities.  The ADMIN file contains NO reference
to the contents or purpose of these sites - so could be mistakenly implicated in the
child pornography ring.  That is why immediate action must be taken, according to news
reports, screening of Cara's HDD is well underway, and the news reports more raids are coming.

Before I summarise, I would like to take an opportunity to thank everyone for helping
myself and my creation, ATN, for giving us a chance.  We formed in Sept 97, and closed
at my command at Sept 98.  I apologise for the problem that has arisen, I wish there
was something that I could have done to prevent it.  
I only first started thinking that Carabus was a paedophile when I heard on the news
that the organisation that had carried out the raid on Carabus, had at the same
time performed porn raids across the USA and in cooperation with other countries around
the world.  Constantly monitoring the news and webpages in USA, I finally came across
the information I have been dreading (http://www.courant.com/news/article/ctnews1.stm).

I am scared to think of how long Carabus has been electronically monitored, many people
could also be in danger.

Summary:
1) Only ONE ATN member is busted and is facing child porn and piracy charges.
2) Siteops must take action to protect themselves and their site, it does not matter
   where you are located, the governments are working in tandem.
3) If you think you are in danger, follow your instinct, safe than VERY sorry.
4) On behalf of Carabus, ATN and myself apologise for the threat that is b4 us all.
5) Heinz J. Schaeffers aka CARABUS - YOU ARE ONE SICK MOTHER FUCKER AND I HOPE YOU
   SUFFER THE PAIN THOSE CHILDREN DID.  I HOPE THEY WARMLY GREET YOU IN PRISON.
6) Thanks for reading this letter, it is important to me that you are warned.
7) CARA IS COOPERATING WITH AUTHORITIES ACCORDING TO THE NEWS !!?!
   WTF DOES THAT MEAN?

I am upset to see all my effort go wasted like this, ATN was a good group that 
deserved a better end.  Thank you to all ATN members (bar one of them), you are fine
people.
My final words are "linfXp should be unbanned - its the only way anyone can trade 0sec,
especially from distant locations, and it is freely available to all.  Any serious
group has at least one group shell trading box".

It seems Class is the most popular group in the scene today according to a new poll conducted by the Just The Facts magazine. Out of the 600 votes received so far Class has gained 39% of the count. Surprisingly Divine (18%) is coming second with Razor and Paradigm (14%) both neck and neck for third place. This poll can give you an idea of the number of clueless people who are into warez when you consider Divine's complete lack of quality and Razors total lack of releases.
<p>
I was mistaken when I claimed that Reflux's release of Robert D. Ballard's TITANIC: CHALLENGE OF DISCOVERY was an educational title. TKLP sent an annoymous and misleading email in reguards to this topic so I took it upon myself to find out more. If one goes to http://www.pimcom.com (Panasonic Interactive) it states that the title is indeed a game.
