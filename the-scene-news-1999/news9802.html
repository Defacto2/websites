</B><P>Razor 1911 broke? Well this isn't the first time. But it does seem they do not have enough money (or a good cc supplier) to pay for their webpage which has vanished.<br>
On the subject of webpages Paradigm has gained another new domain, this time it's www.pdmworld.com. Now knowing Paradigm and their luck with cc's I'm sure this domain won't survive for more then 4 months.</P>
