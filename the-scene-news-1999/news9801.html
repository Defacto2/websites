</B><P>Sorry for the lack of updates lately but there really hasn't been anything interesting to write about, thats why I will be taking a break for 2+ weeks and The Scene News won't be updated until mid Feb.<p>
The Review Guild have finally published the results to their best game of 1997 survey, no surprises here. (http://trguild.ml.org)</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Tuesday 20th January</P>
</B><P>Just over a week ago we had the retirement of the Razor 1911 leader The Punisher. Now we see the lost of one of the most famous women in the scene, China Blue. Her main reasons for leaving according to a big letter she wrote was because of some idiots in Xforce spreading bullshit rumours about her.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Monday 19th January</P>
</B><P>A rumour has been going around the past couple of days that someone has narqed on a provider which hosted Risc's Main. Now I won't go mention names but the owner blames MrX (for anonymity sakes). But MrX puts the blame on a MrY, a MrY who has apparently been busted.</P>

</B><P>My ISP has been messing up, by not allowing me to upload anything via ftp and hence the current lack of updates on this site.</P>
Well finally we are seeing some games for 1998, some are okay and others are not so okay. But it's better then nothing I suppose.

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Tuesday 13th January</P>
</B><P>Well it's official, The Punisher has retired from Razor 1911. His farewell letter on scenelink.org seems all too simular to previous Razor 1911 retirement announcements. Fortunately though, the new Razor 1911 leader will be the very competent Pitbull. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Monday 12th January</P>
</B><P>I've just finished reading the newest Affinity issue, number 15. Unfortunately unless you are a fan of their highly useless 'insanity' section you should not bother with this issue. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Sunday 11th January</P>
</B><P>According to the head man at scenelink.org, the leader of Razor 1911 The Punisher has spoken to a few people about retirement. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Saturday 10th January</P>
</B><P>Feeling desperate for some new games? Sick of betas and can't wait for Star Craft, Ultima 9 or Jagged Alliance 2? Well there is always Winblows 98, the Windows spoof game based really on nothing at all. But unfortunately for me I'll pass on this one, 74 disks plus a video addon is just a bit too much. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Wednesday 7th January</P>
</B><P>After over a year of idling Wave has released issue 12. This magazine was around back in 1996 and was never really successful, maybe 1998 will be a better year for these guys. Designed for Windows 32bit you can grab a copy of this magazine from Efnet #council or http://www.wave.org (which is currently down).</P>
<P>Speaking of emags a little bird has told me that the code for Syndication (the post-RCN mag) is almost complete. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Sunday 4th January</P>
</B><P>Well The Scene News page has received a facelift for 1998, tell us what you think by clicking the big email picture at the top of this page. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Saturday 3rd January</P>
</B><P>Street Fighter fans will be interested to know that CLASS has released Street Fighter Zero (c) Capcom.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800000"><P>I've added a random image java script at the bottom of this page. If you want your group's webpage banner to be added just send it to me via email with the URL link. Only the higher quality scene pages will be added. </P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Thursday 1st January</P>
</B><P>Happy new year every body!<BR>
It seems Class managed to out-do every other game group to release the first game for 1998, Front Page Sports Ski Racing by Sierra. </FONT>
