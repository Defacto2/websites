<p><font face="arial" size="2">
The war of words between Origin and Paradigm went one step further yesterday when ICE discovered that he had been demoted to Loser access on The Underground.
The Underground is a web based bulletin board system run by Paradigm that holds news-group type discussion. Ice had been using the board to rag on Paradigm and it seems they have demoted him to shut him up.<br>
So remember 'TU: Where the elite speaks' unless you rag big brother :)

<p><font face="arial" size="2">
The cash-strapped Reflux realising they could not cut it in the competitive games scene have killed the group and moved off to ISOs. Well I suppose it is harder to stuff up in the ISO scene then it is in the games scene. This makes Reflux the first group to go completely ISO only.

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>Sunday 25th October (6:40pm GMT) - Origin Accepts Limits</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Origin while not joining the Fuction (or as they call it 'Fucktion') has accepted and will now use their disk limit of 50 * 2.88. Here is what they have to say in their latest NFO, Space Bunnies Must Die (c) Ripcord Games.
<p>
Well as you can see this release is well over the SPA disc limit of 75!    
We wanted to wait until a proper SPA meeting to propose a NEW disc limit.  
But due to the goings on out of our hands and the arrival of this title we 
have choosen to release this title as the masses demanded it. In relation  
to the SPA, ORIGIN members feel they can no longer remain a part of the    
SPA as we no longer conform to the SPA rules. Thus we are leaving the SPA  
until further notice. Stay tuned ;).                                       
<p>                                                                           
As for any future raggings that will say we have U-turned and back-tracked 
on what we have said, let us make it clear. It was not ORIGIN's policy to  
keep the disc limit at 75 discs. In fact it was SKILL of CLASS who         
clamoured for this limit to be enforced. Surprising that he went back on it
so if anyone is two-faced it is him. So if we did not campaign for that    
then what were we going on about in previous NFOS ??? Well our view was    
two groups tried to FORCE their views in a dictatorship type manner on the 
rest of the SPA membership, without consulting them. They tried to do this 
by releasing games which broke SPA rules, WHILE still remaining members of 
the SPA at that time. We at ORIGIN have left SPA so therefore are no longer
obligated to adhere to SPA rules. Unlike other groups we respect SPA and   
have no wish to try and FORCE our ideas on the rest of the scene. Thus we  
believed it was better to leave the SPA rather than disrespect the scene.  
Our intention when we was in the SPA was to obtain rules against RAPES. In 
a hope to bring QUALITY and STANDARDS to the scene so, all could benefit.  
<p>                                                                           
This PDM and others refused to comment on, they consistently tried to side 
step this issue. Which we thought was important as RAPES is what actually  
brought the issue of DISC LIMITS up. As PDM was raping all the time before.
Anyway that is history, but let me re-iterate when we slagged groups for   
going over the SPA limit. It was becuase at the time they were also members
of SPA. We have gone over SPA limit, but are not members now. Thus we don't
contradict ourselves, such as PDM and RZR did.                             
<p>                                                                           
So, now you know! Anyway ORIGIN has decieded to follow a disc limit size of
0 x 2.88 megabytes, as is the norm these days on the UTIL scene. People   
from the FUCKTION will say this is a victory for them. Which seems most    
strange to us, as 1) we where never for or against the DISC LIMIT and 2)   
they decieded to leave becuase they claimed people like us were            
unreasonble and would never accept the NEW rules that they have proposed.  
Basicly they cannot say we would never agree to their rules and then say   
they knew we would agree, as it is a contradiction. The fact remains that  
the FUCKTION is made up of groups whoose members while c00l, the leaders   
are all dictators and do not wish to have democratic representation of all 
releasing groups, while they make their BIG PLANS to release cool games,   
like this one! The FACTS are they ran out on the SPA, not the other way    
round. In short PUSSIES. Its a shame their membership has to put up with   
fascism. We feel sorry for them, that is why we wish to talk to the SPA    
members to discuss NEW rules which go BEYOND the FUCKTION set. We hope this
happens for the benefit of all within the scene. Lets stop their dictation 
now!

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>Tuesday 20th October (6:50pm GMT) - FOS Busted</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Fortress Of Solitude (FOS) has been busted for as now, unknown reasons. FOS was Razor 1911 and Radium WHQ, DOD EuroHQ and a RISC affil.
</font><p>

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>Sunday 18th October (12:00pm GMT) - New Game Standards</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
In lieu of recent events contributing to the breakdown of the now defunct S.P.A. (Software Piracy Association), a private meeting between the key contributing and contending groups was held. On October 15th, 1998 an agreement and compromise was reached between the 3 attending parties, CLASS, PARADIGM and RAZOR 1911. Let it be known that this type of compromise could not be achieved under the S.P.A. environment; it took a clean break to accomplish in a day what had previously gone unaccomplished in 2 months.
<p>
The end result being a new council whose sole purpose is to set standards for the game-releasing subsector of the scene, to be adhered to by all admitted parties. Represented members of this new council named THE FACTION, have pledged to abide by the following set of rules created a) to ensure a quality minded end result and b) to encourage fair play and a productive competitive environment for involved groups.
<p>
The Faction 10 Point Program:
<p>
1. The disk limit is as of now 50 x 2.88 megabytes or 2,915,328 bytes.
This equates to a total of 144 megabytes of compressed data or
145,766,400 bytes. Using 2.88 megabyte archives enables us to keep the
standard 8 character filename with a 3 character extension. This will
also help contribute to the elimination of the 'missing disk'
phenomenon, plaguing end-users worldwide. Acceptable compression
formats at this time are ACE or RAR, followed by the traditional
PKZIPing.
<p>
2. Every release under this limit will be a functionally and playably complete game. This means that included will be every component necessary for the successful completion of the game (every level, track, course and other NECESSARY component).
<p>
3. Sound effects WILL and MUST be included.
<p>
4. Intros, Outros and Cut-Scenes should be removed if the size of the
release is 40 x 2.88 disks or more with them included. Intros should
NOT be iuncluded in a Movie Add-On, only Cut-Scenes and Outro (aka
End-Scene) should be included. Animation files, such as .SMKs, should
be 'framed' and not blacked out. Re-indexing of large files, should
consist of an actual re-index instead of just creating a file full of
0's, (which doesn't change the actual file size, but allows it to
compress to virtually nothing), thus promoting more quality minded rips
and cracks.
<p>
5. Only 2 Add-Ons should be released per game. Each Add-On should be no
more than 25 x 2.88 megabyte archives.
<p>
6. A brief outline of what has been stripped from the game should be
clearly stated in the game-release .NFO, as well as information as to
whether or not Add-Ons can be expected.
<p>
7. Children's games (aka Kiddie games) and Edutainment software do not
qualify under THE FACTION's guidelines for acceptable releases.
<p>
8. In regard to games distributed in the United States that are LATER
distributed in Europe or vice versa under the same or different name /
publisher. These games if released AFTER another group's release are
counted as DUPES unless it can be proven that there is a clearly
noticeable PLAYABLE difference in the latter release (eg. new levels,
enhanced graphics, or other new features).
<p>
9. Fully cracked Update Patches and Trainers are highly regarded, though
they are not the responsibility of any group (including that of which
released the original game.) If 2 trainers from the same or different
groups are released for 1 game, this does NOT qualify as a dupe unless
the latter trainer provides no new features over the prior trainer.
<p>
10. Admittance to THE FACTION is done on an invite / vote-in basis. The
group invitation must be proposed before ALL current FACTION member-
group representatives, and the corresponding vote must be undertaken by
ALL FACTION member-group representatives. This council operates in a
purely democratic manner and all parties therein have upon joining,
agreed to follow all stated guidelines of this Declaration of Scene
Independence. Today is not only a new dawn in the games scene, but our
Independence Day where differences are at least temporarily put aside
and our unity re-consolidated.

This document was signed & approved on October 17th, 1998 by the
following
individuals, representing their respective groups:

<p><font face="arial" size="2">
Apparently a couple of days ago the new SPA rules where set. 50 disks * 2.88megs is the new limit while the game must include sfx and music. Videos are required if it is possible to include them. I'm just wondering if Class, Razor and siteops are going to ignore this?

<ul><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>Tuesday 13th October (12:50pm GMT) - Origin Wants PDM Banned</b></font></ul>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">
After Paradigm's insulting NFO Cypher representing Origin has something to say ..
<p>
People lets be clear on one thing, SPA membership is comprised of the following groups:                                                          
<p>
CLASS, RAZOR, PARADIGM, ORIGIN, REFLUX, DIVINE, HYBRID                                                                     
<p>                                                                            
 All of these groups are FULL members of the SPA and have EQUAL vote.       
 Some of these groups are new groups that comprise OLD SCHOOL members like  
 Origin for example. Where CYPHER and RAKIM have been around since BEFORE   
 the Amiga days. Where as other groups like PARADIGM seem old but comprise  
 newbies like ZEUS who has only ever been on PC.                            
<p>
 For the lamers out there the SPA has not, I repeat NOT had a FINAL vote    
 on the DISC limit, thus the limit is still 75 and no greater. For those    
 people who think different or wish to try and force a higher limit upon    
 SPA members, guess what? No chance FUCKERS! Some people say who is SPA     
 to say what the limits are? Why do we need order ??? Why do need limits ?? 
 90 is needed ???                                                           
 Well SPA is made of the groups whos games you download time and time again.
 Game like this MAJOR title. If we have decided to set up a commmitie to    
 discuss scene matters when we the groups make up the majority of pirate    
 GAME releases, where that majority is +90% then you should at least        
 repect our wishes as a UNITED SPA on these issues. We need order/rules     
 of some kind in the scene to stop lameness. Lameness such as BETAS, RAPES, 
 UNCRACKED games, BREAKS, DUPES, KIDDIEWARE and basiclly SHIT. Its about    
 bringing quality to our scene so, that its worth while. After all why      
 bother with pirate warez if its not worth it. Thus some sort of standards  
 has been developed to avoid the CRAP.                                      
 Disc limits are needed for various reasons. One of the biggest reasons is  
 the fact that not everyone has fast lines. And people do not want to leech 
 hundreds of megs to find out its a load of crap. Others would argue that   
 if they do not have fast lines then they are lamers. Well there are two    
 points that provbe this wrong. One is that if you have a fast link then    
 you can leech the ISO anyway and warez should mean jack all to you anyway. 
 The second is many elite people who contribute to the scene are still on   
 28.8k and have done more for the scene than your lamo site or trader group.
 But by far the biggest reason and never answered reason is how does one    
 tell the difference between ISO and WAREZ? Where is the line drawn?. The   
 answer is with a DISC limit. And to keep that limit as small as possible   
 in order to greater distinguish the differences between WAREZ and ISO.     
 The surggested 90 limit also seems to be another bone of contention. For   
 the record the limit is still 75 DISCS of 1.44 MEG size and no larger.     
 Should this be increased? Well this is still be discussed by the SPA. But  
 the whole reason this came up was not actually becuase its XMAS and loads  
 of sizable games are comming, but becuase of another issue.                
 This issue was RAPES. A RAPE is where a game has been stripped down from   
 the CD but yet not all of the game is their within the release to make it  
 playable. For example a game with no sound or the game is missing the 3DFX 
 or normal GFX files. One group was doing this and refused to believe its   
 releases were RAPES. Even though they had more addons than a Lego set.     
 Thus the discussion on the disc limit was raised and still argued about.   
 Origin have yet to vote on the DISC limit as we would like a VOTE on RAPES 
 with surggested all group agreement on what is a RAPE so, they can be      
 banned and NUKED. Needless to say the group who started this all suddenly  
 refused to accept thispoint of view and then tried to move onto DISC       
 raising to escape the flak they received over RAPES. We don't mind this    
 except that we kind of get the idea that this group would eventually       
 start RAPING again even when the limit is 90. You see when you take away   
 their RAPES, DUPES, UN-CRACKED, BETAS and BREAKS. This group does not have 
 many good release like this one. The group that has caused all this shit   
 is PARADIGM. I know that you maybe think that PDM stand for quality and in 
 the past they used too. But they have let it slip and its slipped badly.   
<p>
 The Rise and Fall of PARADIGM:                                             
 PDM was started by newbies like Zeus, who before this group had never      
 started or ran his own group, unless you count group ZEUS. But enough said 
 about that lameness the better. PDM when they started, were out to be the  
 most quality group on the scene. They even laid down some GREAT standards  
 for others to follow. As we shall see they themselevs have failed to follow
 those same high standards.At the start PDM laid out 5 goals that they would
 archive and contine to follow. Whilst they did indeed archive these most   
 noble standards as will be seen they failed to live upto them all the time.
 These texts are taken from an NFO on the PDM website:                      
<p>
  PDM GOALS:                                                                
  To help illustrate this point, here are the goals we intend to            
  fulfill in our release process:                                           
<p>
    1.)  No CD-RAPES                                                        
         ~~~~~~~~~~~                                                        
         Some games are best left unripped and we don't intend on           
         raping games just for the sake of a release. We feel that          
         if a game can't be stripped down to an enjoyable version,          
         its not worth releasing.                                           
    NOTE: PDM's original primary goal is what they seem to break the most.  
          F15 had no sound, MotorCross needed a level RAPED out as an addon 
          by them. Ultimate Race Pro had how many addons ??? Might & Magic 6
          another blatent RAPE. And the list goes on. RAPING is what PDM    
          do best and it also happens to be against their own original      
          number 1 standard.                                                
<p>                                                                            
    2.)  No KIDDY games                                                     
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                     
         At Paradigm, we feel kiddy games should be best left to            
         groups that specialize in those games, since they typically        
         do not appeal to any real fans of the game scene.                  
    NOTE: To be fair to PDM I have not seen a kiddie game from them.        
<p>                                                                            
    3.)  No BUDGET titles                                                   
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                   
         You may be asking yourself why certain game release groups         
         must resort to releasing below-standard, and sometimes             
         just plain cheezy games. Many of these games can be found          
         in the $10 game basket at your local CompUSA or OfficeDepot.       
         We feel this problem stems from a serious lack of                  
         professionalism, and Paradigm will refrain from releasing          
         those types of titles, and instead leave them for lesser           
         groups to gobble up.                                               
    NOTE: hmmm never seen a budget ware from PDM as well.                   
<p>                                                                            
    4.)  No RE-releases                                                     
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                     
         If a game has been put out and its v1.0 or newer, that's           
         a good indication that it's a final and working version.           
         As we have stated before, we are not desperate for                 
         releases. We will always release final versions of games           
         we get, and don't intend to "finalize" any release just            
         because we are angry that we lost on the original release.         
    NOTE: Just when you thought PDM were only breaking one of their own rule
          They ignore another.  Two DUPES they have released that I know of 
          are the infamous MACHINE HUNTER and PROJECT AIROS. Zeus claimed   
          MACHINE HUNTER wasn't final in the NFO. Well it was, just badly   
          cracked. He then claimed later that it was final but not cracked  
          properly. Well then they should have done it as a fix and not a   
          release. Also even if that was true, if you read above closely    
          PDM state they will not finalise any other groups release anyway. 
          So, you see Zeus is talking shit on that release anyway. PROJECT  
          AIROS was of course proven to be another game and that was just   
          its euro name. Mistakes happen they would say. But what about     
          when you dupe on purpose becuase you feel like it? They would say
          they never do that. But they did! Ultra Violent Worlds was a DUPE 
          of the DIVINE release. They even say so in the NFO:               
<p>                                                                            
       "While i was working DVN beat us but i still put it out - maybe you  
        like it more on 2 disks instead of 18 :) - its the same game. "     
<p>                                                                            
        While 2 discs is nice, as the NFO says "its the same game." clearly 
        breaking PDM's own standards.                                       
<p>                                                                           
    5.)  No NON-WORKING releases                                            
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                            
         Unworking releases are the single most irritating thing            
         people in the scene have to deal with. Allowing this to            
         happen at a constant rate is a disgrace to the scene, and          
         should not be tolerated by any major game release group            
         out there. Many of the bad rips and botched cracks by the          
         groups in the early days of the CD scene could at least be         
         attributed to not having prior experience with this new            
         media. But seeing this still happen on a regular basis by          
         today's CD release groups can only be the product of sheer         
         laziness and just not caring enough about the quality of           
         a release. Paradigm intends to break this trend, and by            
         doing so, guarantee a level of integrity to all of our             
         releases, so that people out there don't have to be afraid          
         of grabbing the latest and greatest release for fear that          
         it won't work.                                                     
    NOTE: PDM used to be quite good at this in the past. Unfortnatly its    
          all gone to shit recently. V2000 SAVE fix, many fixes for Might
          & Magic. The list goes on. Their Monaco release will also only    
          work on some peoples machines as its badly cracked.               
<p>                                                                            
   CONCLUSION:                                                              
   Its not very impressive when you set out 5 clear goals and then fail     
   to keep to these standards with success being only obtained with 2 out   
   the 5. Before you start a slagging match with anyone from ORIGIN.        
   Remember these are PDM's standards not anyone elses. This is what PDM    
   belives to be elite! Yet they fail to meet these so called great goals   
   of theirs. Therefore by their own definition they are LAME! They used to 
   have a good repuatation, but now its all gone down the shitter.The cracks
   are more like the old fuck ups FFC used to do. Some poeple have even said
   FFC cracks for PDM as the amount of fixes are about the same level! But  
   we belive this to be false, as not even FFC needed as many fixes as PDM  
   PDM claim no one is running the group and its open. Yet we all know ZEUS 
   is a stalinist dictator and runs the group with a kulak style operation. 
   Hes even black mailed people from other groups into rejoining PDM after  
   they have left or he would NARC them. And has stolen money from poor     
   Russians who need software to sell for bread. Yes ZEUS sells! Its all    
   one big corprate biz from ZEUS INC. That one good HARDWARE supplier he   
   keeps advertising for is actually number 3-4 now. And the selling of     
   DAT tapes must bring in a few thousand dollors! Thats why ZEUS needs to  
   raise the limit, to keep the releases going now that they have lost the  
   quality. So, the business can keep selling. And he can rake the profits  
   in. Yes not only are PDM lame, but they are moeny lamers as well.And they
   do it at the expense of the good scene people. BAN PDM WAREZ now!        
   After all, its over the limit and a load of uncracked raped duped shit   
   anyway. And when it isn't, its BETA!                                     
   Do not put up with newbie ZEUS lameness anymore, BAN PDM warez NOW!

Class recently included the following notice in their NFO files ..
<p>
In light of recent  events perpetrated by  our so-called  competition, we at  CLASS PC would like to make a few things clear to you the end-user:  Over the past 2 days we have witnessed new heights of lameness - as 2 groups  who are  self-proclaimed  abiders of the  S.P.A. regulations chose  to break  those  very agreed  upon guidelines  while attempting to cover it up through  false claims that  a supposed final S.P.A. vote had  taken place as  well as  an agreement to usher in a new disk limit of 90 x 1.44MB disks.  This is  completely and  blatantly false.  Yes the  groups who  comprise the  S.P.A. committee  have  been and  still  are discussing the  possibility  of  raising the  disk limit.  Coincidentally this is  an  ammendment that  we at  CLASS PC  do NOT  and we  cannot possibly stress  how  stern we  are in  our  convictions  that we do NOT want  the limit raised  above 75 x 1.44MB disks.  The 2  above mentioned  groups would have  you believe that CLASS  voted YES  in the  supposed final vote  that  never took place, but  this is FALSE.  In  the preliminary  votes, we voted NO  and in the final  vote we will  vote NO  to the further degredation of the games scene.  The entire purpose of the CD-RIP games  scene is, was and always  will be to  deliver an end  product that is of a size that  can be easily downloaded and  played by  those who  do NOT have  high-speed  modem connections - while  at  the  same  time delivering  a product that  has  complete functionality  and  playability.  As the current limit  stands at  75 disks, we and  every other  group with any  miniscule amount of stripping/cracking knowledge can achieve  this ideal product.  There are roughly 5-10% of games put on the market that  cannot be released below this limit  with an appropriate  music  addon if so  requested.  Those 5-10% of games are games that  should either a) be bought,  thus  supporting  the  software  developers  we so  often  neglect  or b) be  downloaded in the fast growing, largely available ISO format.  It is in the best  interest of the end-users, siteops  and active groups  to  quash  this  proposition now, before  we all suffer blows in the  categories  of  quality rips  and quality  of software released.  We can safely say that  very  few if  any are  interested in 90  disk non-standalone  addons, or  in  a worst case scenario, 90 disk multimedia Mah-Jong or edutainment software.  We're sorry to  have  drawn this out  so long, but  there  is so much  to be  said as far as this issue goes.  In conclusion, we do  NOT condone a 90 disk  limit on game rips released.  We did NOT vote yes in the S.P.A. tallies.  We  will ALWAYS continue  to try our hardest to  bring you small game rips, with  functionality  and playability intact - along  with appropriate  addons.  We  understand  that  the  vast  majority of  you are  on  56k or  slower  modem  connections, and you deserve to be able to download the software you want in  a reasonable  amount  of time.  Those of  you  who can  afford faster  links  should  look  to  the  future, to  ISOs for  those  5-10% of  games that  go  unreleased  because  they cannot  fit in 75 x 1.44MB archives.  Take time to  reflect  on  the  above  presented  issue, and make  it  known to  all  your  favorite game release groups that you are  all-for  the preservation  of the  games scene, hence you are against raising the disk limit at this time.
<p>
Following Class's actions, Paradigm now includes a counter statement in their NFOs ..
<p>
It's funny how class reacts (they did this last time when the limit changed to 75) when a clear vote has been approved by the SPA for the new 90 disk limit.<br>
Here are the final results:<br>
Paradigm - yes<br>
Razor    - yes<br>
Hybrid   - yes<br>
Class    - no<br>
This was really the vote for 100 - but since we all know there are a few little groups out there - like DVN, OGN and RLX, we decided to hear them out - and since some were opposed to the 100 limit (as CLS), we compromised with the little groups on 90 - We thought this was extremely fair - considering OGN has release 2 games as the newbies, Devine puts out childrens software and beta's, and Reflux goes to the budget titles. Nothing wrong with any of this of course, we need little groups to co-exist (otherwise, what is a "big group") We are not really sure why Class feels the need to stop this progress of an increase in limit - other then a mere power trip (it's lonely at the top, but good to be king sound familiar?). What does the extra 15 disks mean? Better games coming out, less rip of code (always a bad thing), and for those still on the slow 56k - a whole 1 HOUR of extra downloading time. To groups like class, and the little groups that agree with them, feel free to continue at your 75 disk limit, but don't try and modify the SPA rules after the vote is over. The new official limit is 90!
<p>
Is this what Paradigm has to do to show people they believe they are right, insult the socalled 'little' groups left, right and center? Well I wouldn't exactly call Hybrid a big group these days either.
<p>
What will happen from now is that Class will continue to support the old SPA standard while obviously all the other groups will support the newer standard. The funny thing though is that Class during some months release more titles then all the other groups put together. The question is how far will Class go in ignoring the new 90 disk limit? Will these 76+ disk titles be nuked on Class affiliated sites? Will Class re-release 76+ disk titles under the old 75 disk system (if the option is available)? Well the answer is really up to the all the site-ops on which standard they wish to choose. If most of the sites nuke 76+ disk titles then the new SPA believers are not going to bother. Just remember as a true conservative would say, change isn't always a good thing.
