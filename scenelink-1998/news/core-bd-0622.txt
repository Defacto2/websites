Happy Birthday CORE CRACKERS !

On the 22nd June 1998 CORE becomes one year old since I, Mad aLeX, took
over the leading position in the group. CORE is my personal dream of a
perfect organised cracking group. And I'm proud to tell you that this
dream has become true. CORE is the best organised and coordinated
group in the whole scene. No Idlers, No waste of time, only loyal members
and big friendships. CORE has developed to something that is a little bit
more than just a "normal" cracking group. We never have internal fights.
We never have problems with big "ego's" that are trying to dominate the
group. No cracker ever left CORE for another group. I tried to bring
some aspects of the very old scene spirit into the group and I think
that my attempt was successful. Everyone in CORE knows that he is
important and that idling hurts the group and that the quality of every
crack is very important.

In 365 days we produced more keymakers than any other cracking group.
This is the result of non-stop hard working crackers. Our release
average per month has risen again this year.

I would like to thank all CORE members for their hard work during the
last 12 months. CORE is a very fine group and it's good to see that there
is still real friendship in the scene.

But today I also say goodbye to my CO-Leader DrRhui who will retire
officially on the 23rd June from the scene to make big money in real
life, now. I never had a member that was more loyal to my style of leading
a group. Thank you for all the time you invested into CORE.

Well, happy birthday CORE and keep on rocking. Noone knows for how long
we'll exist in the future. But we'll know when our time to go has come!

Mad aLeX
CORE LEADER
