P2 Follow Up: Runtime vs Devide/0 </b></font><font color="#808080">
crowe <br></font>
There is alot of talk still going on about this P2 Problem. There are actually
2 problems going on. 1. The Devide By Zero Problem which Radman as well as others have
informed there is a patch for. The ttpatch, which seems to work on TURBO PASCAL programs.
This is a fairly common bug and there are several solutions. 2. This second bug, the Runtime
Error seems to be a bit smaller problem because it only affects a small percentage of dos
bases apps. The tpppatch seems to fix some of those as well, but not all. I will use
AdidView in my example. Whenver you try to run  it, it will give you a runtime error. On the
Klamath Processor you get the run time number ending with 91, however on a duechetts P2, its
89. It is related to the Pentium Pro Instruction code in the processor itself. P Pro's (P2's
are simply p-pro's with ecc and mmx) were not meant to run dos based apps really, so we may
have to concede this one to Intel and write 32 bit applications.

Hello all, i do believe i've come up with a pretty good idea and id like to share it! we all know how much
appz,games and addons etc is being nuked daily, the releasers of the appz,games and addons
allmost allways know that their release are going to be nuked on most sites, but some of the
releases are actually good even tho its nukes. so why not make a new ummm genre..lets call
it unreleased, where all the cliparts and all the manuals and old game addons etc etc ends
up, i dunno, maybe its a bad idea.. after all its only my lame idea...! :)

This may seem a little off topic, but it is a major topic on irc lately. I
myself have discoverd that most of the dos based Viewers, Loaders, and drawing programs that
we all know and love WILL give you a RUNTIME ERROR on a Pentium 2 class processor. I work at
PC-Systems and I tried the programs on 12 differnt P2 Systems with the same error. The past
few days on irc, I have talked to several other people with the same problem. I sent e-mail
to Radman about Acidview and Aciddraw, Bluedevil is telling the CIA coding team. Hopefully
the rest of you will see this and we can adress the issue. Werd.

After many messages i responded to in regard the first SSA meeting, and
explaining over and over again that all we did was to organize a meeting to see if there
COULD be a coalition for the efnet warez scene ...i would like to summarize for everybody at
the same time  =) first of all, the meeting on june 7th was an 'organizational' meeting, and
we did what we set out to do..brought together as many 'leaders' from efnet scene as we
could for discussion, etc secondly, any discussion is good - whether it is about security,
sites, uniform standards...its all good, and only good can come out of such ..thirdly, at
this time there are several individuals who are trying to organize a coalition of sorts
...which is good, but  i'm not sure they have support or the confidence from scene leaders
they would need to succeed..so i urge them to chat, email, msg ..until they have that
support - then perhaps it will succeed ! And finally, that server we used is NOT
private...and there will NOT be a password to access it. It's there for all of you to use as
an alternative, just follow the normal rules and don't fukup or it wont be there =)

Defacto 2 Metamorphosing </b></font><font color="#808080">
Ipggi <br></font>
Defacto 2 Art Division has decided to refocus it's efforts to web requests
only. This means we will not be accepting any new requests or non-web applications. This new
move will enable us do most group web requests from a simple logo redesign to a complete
webpage overhaul. We can do professional html, web graphics and designs. Plus we have people
who can implement cgi, javascript, java, music and  Flash. The best thing about this I feel
is that our services are free to non profit scene groups.
<br><br>
Before we accept requests we feel we need more members to help take on the load. We are
looking for people who can do quality html, quality web graphics, custom cgi, custom
javascripts or custom java. If you want to be in the best scene web design group in the
world why not fill out the online application that can found at our page. Our members
previous web work include www.game-over.net, artpacks.acid.org, www.rebels.org and of course
www.defacto2.net.
<br><br>
About Defacto2: Defacto 2 started off as an electronic magazine for the scene community.
After the demise of the magazine the website was transformed into a scene museum that is
still maintained today. A day after new years 1998 Defacto 2 was relaunched and the Defacto
2 Art Division was formed.  This division was created and designed to do free requests for
individuals and groups in the scene. In the June of 1998 the Art Division refocused it's
effort to non profit web requests. Defacto 2 is run by Ipggi, Antibody and Skateguy.  It was
founded by Ipggi and Saint Tok and can be found at <a href="http://www.defacto2.net/">www.defacto2.net</a>.

some feedback as to how we could improve our news process. A script is
currently being written to display news items for each scene (art,
warez, demo, other) and automatically archive the news each month.
There will be several news coordinators for each specific scene that
will use the admin feature of the script to select which news items to
