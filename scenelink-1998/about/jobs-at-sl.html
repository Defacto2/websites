SCENELINK POSITIONS</font></p>

<td width="480"><font face="arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
starters, everyone can help with scenelink. If you hear about something
interesting that we haven't covered, submit it to the news page. Or if you want
to write an article on something you're interested in, let us know and we'll let
you know what our requirements are for freelance articles. Scenelink was
designed to be just this kind of meeting place, for people from all over to
share their knowledge and opinions. News announcements can be submitted on any
news page, or by <a href="../news/news_sub.html">clicking
here</a>. People interested in writing freelance articles should
<a href="mailto:neofish9@scenelink.org">email us here</a>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scenelink
was also designed to be a source for consistent news and analysis, and that's
where we've had some trouble with the freelance model. As much as we love
getting announcements and articles from people outside scenelink, we need to
start balancing these sources with more regular ones to ensure that people can
look forward to new material on a daily basis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're
looking for people to fill several spots. Each position has its own
requirements, but there are also some general requirements for all of them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on scenelink is a job. Nobody gets
paid for it, and we certainly don't expect 20 hours a week from anyone (except
neofish9 and DeZigner), but it IS something that applicants should take
seriously. As seriously as volunteering at a hospital, or working on a school
newspaper, and somewhat less seriously than being the dictator of a small Latin
American country. We expect everyone to be mature about their commitments; if
you promise to do something, it is expected that you do it. If you can't do it,
it is expected that you will let us know in advance, that's what "responsibility"
means. There are too many things going on in scenelink for us to baby you,
please don't waste our time if you can't handle this. Once again, we don't
expect 20 hours a week, we just expect that you be aware of what you can and
can't do, and let us know before there is a problem.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
a lighter note, we expect that everyone have some sense of humor about all this,
love the scene, and have an interest in scenelink's goal of bringing people
within and across scenes together. Scenelink is a little older than most groups,
with an average age of around 20, but any mature, competent, and interested
applicant will be accepted without consideration for age.</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<td>The scene news pages are maintained by the entire scene, or that's the
theory anyway. What we've found in practice is that most people are either
unaware that they can submit news, or just lazy. That's why we're going to start
taking a more aggressive approach to news. We still want to make sure as much
news as possible comes straight from the people involved, but reporters will
help to speed the process along. It will be up the reporters to search out new
events, basically keeping their eyes open at all times. For someone who already
spends a good deal of time in the scene, being a reporter isn't going to mean
more than a few extra minutes a week. When they find news, reporters will
develop it for the news pages. It will be up the reporter, and the News Editor,
whether that means getting a quote from those involved, drawing on another
source to provide a different angle, or just adding a note that the information
is unconfirmed in the interest of getting it up on the news page as quickly as
possible.

<td valign="top"><font size="4">DESCRIPTION:</font></td>
<td>Illustration means just that. Obviously we expect someone who can do more
than filtering in Photoshop, but the main requirement is having creative ideas
for how to visually enhance articles.  The best illustrators for scenelink will

be the ones whose versatility allows them to shape art around content. Sometimes
a realistic 3d rendering might work, and sometimes a deliberately unnatural look
would be better. The point is, if all you can do is little bit of Bryce and
Poser, you'll never be able to do anything that doesn't look unnatural. It's ok
if you have a high degree of proficiency in just one or two styles, as long as
your pieces reflect serious consideration of the effect they have on the viewer.
Illustrators will work with the art director of scenelink.</td></tr>

illustration in a magazine, and tell us what you expect to get out of working on
scenelink. Include 3-5 samples of your work in a zip file attached to your
message that show your preferred style and your range.

<td>The news page is one of scenelink's most important projects. It is the key
to building a daily audience, and probably the most useful resource on scenelink
for keeping people connected to the scenes. The News Editor is responsible for
figuring out ways to find the latest news, and then improving that news as much
as possible. If possible, going from rumor to a quote from those involved about
what's really going on. Whatever it takes to provide readers with accurate and
informative news. Because the news comes out around the clock, the News Editor
must be available to handle these developments or offer advice to others about
how to handle them. There is no set number of hours they should be online each
week, but reporters/writers should be able to expect a response from their
letters within 24 hours under any circumstances, unless otherwise notified.</td></tr>

area. Give several suggestions for how the scenelink news area could be
improved, and how you would direct reporters. Describe your other commitments
and how you think you could work in being the News Editor. Also, submit sample
news announcements about the last 3 news events you were aware of, ideally
between 75-125 words. See the current news page for examples.

job to make sure that current groups cooperating in scenelink send in their info
and that new groups sign up. Each cooperating group has a contact person. The
Scene Index Coordinator will send this person an email about deadlines for index
submission, and keep track of which groups haven't replied, sending reminders or
going to the group's channel as necessary. Basically, anything to make sure that
the scene index contains the most up to date info available. In addition to
being a coordinator, this person is also kind of a spokesman. Groups that want
to join will be sent to them, but they should also make an effort to contact new
groups as they appear. Getting submissions is the required task, but it's also
expected that the Scene Index Coordinator get to know the cooperating groups and
make their involvement in scenelink more personal than a cgi form.</td></tr>

and, of course, why you respect them. Give your thoughts on the current scene
index and how you think it could be modified to better serve readers and
cooperating groups. Find one reputable group not already listed and convince
that group to fill out the coop acceptance form, then include the log of your
conversations along with your letter.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<td valign="top"><font size="4">REQUIREMENTS:</font></td>

towards the latter.</td></tr>

<td>The primary focus of our issues is on news and features, but we'd like to
begin doing a little more non-news material like biographies and interviews.
Non-news just means an examination where nothing special has occurred recently.
For example, an interview with Pitbull about The Punisher's retirement would be
news, while an interview with Eagle1 about his thoughts on how couriering has
evolved with faster connections would be non-news. Non-news does not mean
non-interesting. That's the mistake almost every emag has made, with many of
them devoting entire issues to interviews that had no message to convey. The
Biographies and Interviews Editor will work with writers to create non-news
material with relevance and human interest. Group Biographies are the chance to
tell the cumulative history of a group, and should be treated like screenplays
for movies, as raw materials for a story.  The Biographies and Interviews Editor
will be responsible for deciding which groups and individuals are chosen for an
issue, for assigning writers, and for helping writers to develop an angle for
their pieces.</td></tr>

group biography for a group you are familiar with.</td></tr></tbody></table>
