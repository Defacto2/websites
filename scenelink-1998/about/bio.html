scenelink were the A-Team, I guess I'd have to identify myself as Hannibal
Smith. I'm the idea guy, and sort of the defacto coordinator. I got into the
scene about 6 years ago as an independent bbs courier [read: lamer] in the 360.
On IRC I ran a courier group for awhile, gave that up once college started, and
ended up as a scene artist/idler till the idea for scenelink came to me about a
year ago. I like the scene a lot, but it's really hard to say why. It's
different from anything else out there, but so are lots of things. I guess it's
partly the pace, and partly the weird semi-community that forms around trading
little zips filled with shit that nobody wants. Outside the scene I'm majoring
in English and Film Studies. I write and design for two other magazines, one of
which is the college humor magazine. Eventually I'd like to work in magazines or
film, perhaps magazines covering the film industry, or maybe a film about
magazines.

<p align="left"><font size="+2"><b><tt>Alias: DeZigner<br>Function: Design
Team Coordinator</tt></b></font><br><br><font color="#000040"><b>I joined
the scenelink team way back in April of 97.  Neofish9 was looking for someone to
do a logo for scenelink and I volunteered  for the job. As of today, the
spectacular scenelink logo is still lost somewhere in my subconcious and hasn't
found it's way out yet. After listening to neofish9's vision, I decided I wanted
to become a big part of scenelink. Ever since then I've colaborated with
neofish9 on making scenelink a reality. Scenelink has been an excellent medium
for improving my design skills and a very unique experience interacting with the
"scene."  My first interaction with the scene was an art group called
a-bomb, which lasted about 3 months :) The group is still around today, but we
stopped doing art several years ago. After giving that a go I decided to start a
web design company with a friend. That company has been idle for a while now,
but I'm still very active doing web design on my own. Apart from my computer
life I'm very active in Taekwondo. I've been practicing the art from some 12
years now, I'm a third degree black belt, and compete (sparing) on an Olympic
level. Soon I will be off to college to become an Industrial Dezigner. Look for
www.dezigner.net in the near future, or something similar ( I can't believe
someone took www.dezigner.com !!! )     </b></font></p><br>
