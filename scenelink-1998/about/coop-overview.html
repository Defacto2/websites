<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#000080"><strong>What         ARE
cooperating groups?</strong></font></p>
<p>Coop groups are scene groups that think scenelink is a         cool idea.
They're groups that think it's cool enough         that they want to help out in
the easiest way they can.         They're groups that can see it's in their own
best         interest to become a cooperating group. There's no        
requirement for being a coop group, if you're a scene         group, just fill
out the info on the <a href="sub-coop-acceptance.html">coop acceptance page</a>
        and you're in.</p>
<p>Being a coop group doesn't mean changing anything,         except that you
agree to make a small effort to help         scenelink in one tiny little way,
by sending us an update         on your group so that we can maintain the scene
index.         Sure, maybe we could keep track of everyone's nfo,        
releases, announcements, and retirements, but wouldn't it         be a hell of a
lot easier if you kept track of your own         group? </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#000080"><strong>What         do coop
groups have to do?</strong></font></p>
<p>There are actually two things,<br>         <font size="4">1)</font> Coop
groups need to fill out the        
<a href="../index/index_sub.html">index submission form</a>
once a month. This         is how you send all your announcements and updates to
us,         and this is what ends up becoming your group's entry in         the
scene index. It should take about 5 minutes per month         to fill out.</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0">

<td bgcolor="#eaeaea" width="490" align="center"><font size="2">find out what
we ask, check out the </font><a href="../index/index_sub.html"><font size="2">index
submission form</font></a></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><font size="4">2)</font> Coop groups         need to pick one member of
their group who will be the         "contact person." This is the
person scenelink         will ask whenever we have questions. They're also the  
      only person in your group who ever needs to think about         scenelink.
At the very most they will get a short coop         group listserv from us once
a week, and they'll have to         fill in the index submission form once a
month. Scenelink         will remind everyone about deadlines, all you have to
do         is want to participate.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#000080"><strong>What         do coop
groups get out of this?</strong></font></p>
<p>For starters, you get the satisfaction of knowing that         you're
helping to make this cooperative project between         groups possible. But
you get tangible stuff too, like...<br>         <br>         <font size="4">Y</font>our
group gets an entry in the<strong>        </strong>scene index, where you can
display your nfo,         releases, announcements, and anything you want. It's a
        way of making it easy for people to keep track of your         group,
and you provide all the info so there's no problem         with your security.</p>
