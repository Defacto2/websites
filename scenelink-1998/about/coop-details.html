<a name="goal"><font face="Arial" size="5"><b>Our goal</b></font></a></p>
<p>scenelink exists to provide a single area with resources for individuals and
groups in the Art, Demo, MP3, and Warez scenes. Our goal is to make accurate and
important information available, and to make it possible to communicate easily
with the scenes as a whole.</p>
<p>The aim of this is to establish a common ground between scenes which will
help to bring about the kind of stability which we feel has been painfully
absent. As anyone's who's been in a scene for more then a few years is aware,
things are no longer like they used to be. Improved technology has made it
easier for people to enter the scene, but with that has come an incredible boom
in the population of lamers. It's now much, much easier for people to be in the
scene without knowing anything about those who came before them, without being
aware ofwhat's happening in their own scene, and certainly without knowing
anything at all about what's going on in other scenes.</p>
<p>Much of this is due to a change in the way the scene operates; everything
has moved from the bbses to the net, and the result has been total chaos. Most
boards had a life span of several years, which allowed them to function as
institutions; a board was a center for scene life which helped to inspire
respect for the scene. Now of course, the board has been replaced by a mix of
temporary ftp sites, various irc channels, and a few scattered and sporadically
updated websites and newsgroups.</p>
<p>The chaos which greets people as an introduction to the scene inspires very
little respect, and people without respect for the scene end up becoming
irritating lamers. They never really get introduced to the scene, instead they
just get dumped into#warez666 or a similar channel. They are uncivilized because
they grew up without parents; scenelink can show people what they're missing.
There will always be lamers, but lameness is a treatable disease.</p>
<p>If this all sounds unusual, that's because it is. People are always harping
about unity in the scene, about getting things done rather than wasting energy
fighting each other, but so far all this bitching has achieved very little. The
reason for this is because up until now the ones calling for scene unity were
either individuals, or groups within a specific scene. Individuals, and even
groups, lack the resources to effectively promote scene unity; their main
concern is putting out packs, couriering, etc. so that's where they spend their
energy. While there have been small scale alliances like RIP or the SPA in the
Warez scene, these alliances were not separate entities apart from the members
themselves, which we feel is necessary to ensure the level of stability and
impartiality we are striving for. These alliances were also almost always
between groups of a single scene, because the members lacked interest or
resources to expand their alliance. scenelink is the first group that is really
capable of effectively promoting stability and a sense of community across
scenes because as a group, that is where all of our resources go. And because
scenelink belongs to no scene in particular, it can bridge the gap between all
scenes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<a name="agenda"><font face="Arial" size="5"><b>Our agenda</b></font></a></p>
<p>"Promoting a sense of community" covers a huge range of possible
things for scenelink to be doing, which is why we have decided to focus
initially on just a few projects. With a small number we can be sure that what
we do, we will do well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Current scene news; very brief summaries of events that happened in the
past month like group mergers/deaths/and startups, and any other major
developments in the scene, on irc, or on the web.</li>
<li>A listing of groups in each scene which will be updated monthly to include
more current information. The purpose of this listing is to record group deaths,
mergers, and births, and to provide groups with a chance to make themselves
known. To see what the index looks like, check it out.</li>
<li>A list of releases maintained by the release groups themselves, to provide
up to the minute updates on who put what out, who duped it, who fixed it, etc.</li>
<li>A gallery of selections from current art packs.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<a name="looking"><font face="Arial" size="5"><b>Why we're looking for coop
groups</b></font><font size="5"><b></b></font></a></p>
<p>The big question all of this raises is, "ok so you want to do a website
with scene info, what does this have to do with my group?" What scenelink
needs is cooperation. Maintaining group index and news sections which are as
accurate, thorough, and current as what we're planning for simply cannot be done
without support from the groups themselves. You have the most accurate
information about your group, so you'rethe best ones to provide it.</p>
<p>To become a center for scene resources, we need more than just good content,
we need good advertising as well. Advertising lets people know scenelink exists,
and by getting our URL and nfo widely distributed we also show people that
scenelink has the broad level of support that it does.</p>
<p>The final reason we need coop groups is for the input on how scenelink
should develop. The scenes pride themselves on their sense of community, but the
only community tie that actually exists for most scenes is that things take
place on irc. Cooperating with scenelink creates a tie that can serve as a
foundation. All coop groups receive a bi weekly mailing from scenelink, and the
mailing will be a good way for groups to communicate with one another and to
address issues in the scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<a name="have"><font face="Arial" size="5"><b>What coop groups have to do</b></font><font size="5"></font></a></p>
<p>Being a coop group is as easy as you want to make it. Officially, the only
thing that we ask coop groups to do is send in their index form once a month..
It can be done over the web, so it should take a max of about 5 minutes..</p>
<p>The index allows us to verify that your group is still alive, and to gather
feedback from all corners of the scene. Were commend that your group assign one
person to be responsible for sending in the info to make things easier. This
person will receive a reminder from scenelink several days before the info is
due.</p>
<p>While not required, help with advertising scenelink is greatly appreciated.
The more people hear about www.scenelink.org the better. Here are some
suggestions for ways you can help,</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding our web address to your nfo</li>
<li>Adding a greet to "scenelink" in your group's nfo</li>
<li>Including an add for scenelink on your group's offer bots</li></ol>
