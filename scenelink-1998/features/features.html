<td width="490" colspan="3"><font size="2"><b>3</b> months ago, the NET act
radically changed how software pirates could be prosecuted in America, removing
not-for-profit loopholes that had been written before massive copying of
copyrighted material took no more than an ftp client. 
<br><br><b>3</b> months later, the NET act has yet to make an appearance.
Robert DePew was the most recent victim of the Software Piracy Association's
(SPA) assault on copyright infringement. Though DePew's website, which provided
visitors with serial numbers and cracks, was specifically mentioned by the SPA
during debate before passage of the NET act, DePew was not prosecuted under the
terms of the NET act. DePew was never even tried at all, as the case was settled
outside of court. In an interview with scenelink, he discusses the experience.
