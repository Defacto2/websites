<p><font size="+1"><b>3</b></font> months ago, the NET act radically changed
how software pirates could be prosecuted in America, removing not-for-profit
loopholes that had been written before massive copying of copyrighted material
took no more than an ftp client. </p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>3</b></font> months later, the NET act has yet to make
an appearance. Robert DePew was the most recent victim of the Software Piracy
Association's (SPA) assault on copyright infringement. Though DePew's website,
which provided visitors with serial numbers and cracks, was specifically
mentioned by the SPA during debate before passage of the NET act, DePew was not
prosecuted under the terms of the NET act. DePew was never even tried at all, as
the case was settled outside of court. In an interview with scenelink, he
discusses the experience.</p></td></tr>

<hr noshade="noshade" width="500" size="1">
<p><font size="5" color="#000080">Who are you?</font><font size="5"> </font></p>
<p>I'm 36, family of 4, work for International Paper on the loading dock where
I am starting to think my talents are going to waste, addicted to the computer
as most of you are or you would not be reading any of this. I pay my bills and
taxes on time, Middle Class, served in the military in South Korea as Military
Police assigned to the 501st M.I. Group - boy wouldn't the guys get a kick out
of this now.</p>
<p><font size="5" color="#000080">What was the site like?</font></p>
<p>100+ Megs of cracks and serial numbers... If you needed something it more
than likely was there. </p>
<p>Why was it up? I still ask myself that question from time to time. It must
have been for the reason most of us look for cracks and such. We are tired of
paying the high cost of software that does not work as advertised. As for
running it, it was like a natural high... I would get behind in updating it and
I would feel guilty that it was not up to date. I must have put in 4-6 hours a
day posting and changing things. </p>
<p><font size="5" color="#000080">Why do you think your site was chosen?
</font></p>
<p>As for how they found it, someone must have reported it somewhere. I was
contacted via a summons delivered to the door around 6pm on Oct 23 while I was
at work. Why was I chosen? I bet they did a credit check and saw that I did not
have the resources to fight them for long.</p>
<p>As to where my name on the site surfaced, a payback will come somewhere
sometime, maybe not soon and not where it will be expected. </p>
<p><font size="5" color="#000080">Who was behind the trial? </font></p>
<p>I think it was the SPA, I have found out that my site was brought up by
Sandra Sellers of the SPA before the committee in charge of the new software law
that was passed in Dec of 97. I was not charged under the new law, only under
the old law. It seems like the SPA was trying to get another press release to
make themselves feel important.</p>
<p><font size="5" color="#000080">How do you feel you were treated? </font></p>
<p>Trial, there was no trial. Had no money for defense, and it would have cost
$10,000+ to fight them. To them it was more like spare change. They started by
wanting $180,000 (you can not get blood from a turnip), my system, and all
papers concerning the site. What better way to fight them than with a copyright
attorney for myself. It's funny that they try to nail you and their clients are
just as guilty of having warez on their own servers. They later dropped to
$9600, then $4800, and we still would not talk to them... then they dropped to
$3600 and we offered $1200. They came back with $1800. My attorney fees were
getting up there and the difference from the $1800 to what it would have cost to
go on was not worth it </p>
<p><font size="5" color="#000080">When you ran the site, were you aware of the
NET act? </font></p>
<p>I didn't not really think about it at the time while running the site. You
look at the punishments and it's mostly community service and such with
suspended fines and court orders to stop doing it.</p>
<p><font size="5" color="#000080">How aware are/were you of the warez scene?</font>
</p>
<p>All I will say on that is see no warez, speak no warez, hear no warez. I ran
a bbs at one time for 9 years and have seen a lot.</p>
<p><font size="5" color="#000080">How has this incident affected your life,
and your attitude towards the warez scene? </font></p>
<p>Not really affected my life, or my attitude towards the warez scene.</p>
<p>DO IT BUT DON'T GET BUSTED. IF BUSTED FIGHT THEM.</p>
<p>If I had the money for the fight I would have fought them tooth and nail.
Remember this was an out of court settlement, not a trial as the SPA seems to
make everyone think. I never saw anyone connected with this from their side.
</p>
<p><b>1.)</b> $50 per month for 36 months or as the official papers say 36
timely payments (is that 1 per day for 36 days) or do it like they want me
thinking of them for 36 months (that will be the day). </p>
<p><b>2.)</b> Court Order against doing it again (if caught again it's the
full $180,000. Wish I had 1% of that in the bank right now). </p>
<p><b>3.)</b> A report on my activities. Too bad the sites in my report are
missing and were they ever even up to begin with? </p>
<p>I WILL NOT RAT ON ANYONE FOR ANYTHING, BUT DO NOT TELL ON ME OR YOU MAY FIND
ME ON YOUR DOORSTEP SOME NIGHT WHEN YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME. Maybe
delivering a pizza you did not order.</p>
