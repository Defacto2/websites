<p><font size="5">I have decided to share relativity's engine with the emag
scene. </font></p>
<p>I have chosen to do this because the emag scene is not what it used to be.
Since every emag releases at most once a month, I decided to make a viewer.
Every time we release a file.mdb which is the dat file you just have to use the
viewer to read it. This saves editors a lot of time beta testing, produces
smaller files, and helps end a lot of compatibility problems . So you ask me, "How
come you didn't keep this to relativity alone?" Well, my answer to you is, "code
counts for 50% of the problems with emags, so if every emag releases under the
same engine, no more code problems."</p>
<p><font size="5">The engine is called, REV Relativity Emag Viewer! </font></p>
<p>Recently, all of the groups (Relativity, CWS, Future Scene News, The Gamers
Edge ) that have agreed to release their emags with the Relativity Viewer, have
formed a universal channel on efnet. Everyone from every emag will help create a
primary channel, a primary ftp site, and a primary website to distribute emags.
This project is being built from scratch and we need everyone from every emag
who is involved to join <b>#emags</b> and help us out. It would be very
beneficial to everyone since ideas can be coordinated from group to group and
issues can be released much quicker than usual. This involves submitting, beta
testing and finally the release (99% bugless) of every emag. The Relativity Emag
Viewer is supported throughout a variety of platforms. Such platforms and
requirements include: </p>
<p>- 486DX/33MHZ OR BETTER - 8MB RAM OR HIGHER (EMS/XMS ENABLED) - VESA 32BIT
OR 64BIT PCI VIDEO CARD (SVGA) - 8BIT SOUND CARD OR BETTER - OPERATING SYSTEMS
INCLUDE DOS, LINUX W/DOSEMU, WINDOWS </p>
<p><font size="5">In order to stay organized we need to set rules,</font></p>
<p>Every emag, newsletter, etc is welcomed :) . </p>
<p>Every emag can decide if it's a tri-weekly, bi-weekly, or other-weekly. </p>
<p>Emag Relations: --------------- </p>
<p>* This is for emags that write scene related articles and interviews or
emags that have sections that are similar to sections in other emags! </p>
<p>No sharing of writers/artists in those emags since everyone has the same
engine. We are starting from a near point and now instead of concentrating on
presidents and seniors. The writers and the artists are very important to us. In
my opinion, an emag with more good writers will rise above the others. The code
will be the same, so the articles will decide which emag is the best."
</p>
<p>No fighting with each other NO MATTER WHAT! </p>
<p>Certain groups that are AFFILED with each other may decide not to be affiled
with other emags, so don't try to steal affiliations and members or this will
cause a removal from <b>#emags</b> (not worth it). </p>
<p><font size="5">Submitting Rules:</font></p>
<p>If the council decides about quality control, emags must meet deadlines or
any other quality control implementation. </p>
<p>For starters, everything is changeable in the engine, so you can do
anything. </p>
<p>All emags should be submitted to Muaddib in a RAR file including all vga art
in GIF 87A format 640x480x256 colors, and all articles in binary files (acid
draw saved as .bin) must be less than 64 * 1024 (64k), Muad Doesn't need
separated files and he wont take them, when you release an issue put every
little thing in the RAR file . </p>
<p>Fli anims should not go above 500k, ansi menus should be 80x25 in .bin files
and all articles must be edited fully, can be in ansi mode, or just plain text
but must be saved as binary! Emag must have its own ansi menus. I will not
provide stuff from relativity or other emags to any group. They must have enough
room for a menu of 9 lines and 50 chars, in the middle. When the engine will be
in vga menus, changes will be announced . </p>
<p>Text file containing the section and subsection topics must be included in
the RAR FILE, in order to compile it, Muad will not do your JOBs, he only
compiles the packs PERIOD . </p>
<p>All RAR packs will be submitted 3 days before the release date, it takes
about that time to compile, and beta test. To be 99% perfect, a pack must be
checked and double checked by the emag releasing it, MuadDib will not take
another file and will not compile over again. Make sure you do it RIGHT the
first time and the packed files must be perfect. </p>
<p>The emag being released, will get a file.mdb, which is the main file that by
using the viewer could be run smoothly. </p>
<p><font size="5">Conclusion: </font> </p>
<p>If you say that in the scene there are 50,000 people couriering, hacking,
cracking everyday and you look at the d\l from the dcc bots you would notice
that it has about 5,000 d\l in 2 days after an emag has been released. Amazing,
a 10% increase! Think about a bigger place with lots of emags taking a cut of up
to a 50% increase of the scene people, reaching everyone out there!, just
imagine 25,000 people reading your little article on the release day ..
Interesting? Yeah, I thought so :) </p>
