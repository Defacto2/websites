<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="+2">W</font>hen tourists come to
Warsaw they can see a lot of interesting things. I don't want to describe Warsaw
attractions, because all of them are found on maps and guide books. But there is
a special place that should interest people who like computers. I'm talking
about the warez market on Grzybowska street. Most people call it "Grzybek"
(Mushroom), or "Warezowa gielda" (Warez market). Officially it's known
as the "Centralna Gielda Komputerowa" (Central Computers Market).
</font></p>
<p>The market started up in 1989, after the death of communism in Poland. The
original vendors were mostly BBS sysops looking for a place to buy/sell hardware
and software and exchange information about computers. Warez vendors today tend
to be young, ranging anywhere from 16 to 30. Most are apprentices or students,
but a few support themselves entirely with warez. </p>
<p>Customers, who are usually about the same age as vendors, are even allowed
to test out software on mobile machines setup by vendors, an opportunity rarely
found in traditional software stores. On an average weekend, the market draws
about 50,000 guests.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#0000ff">The wares</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The warez market takes place in three places,
all right next to each other. The largest is about 10000m2, and is only for
hardware and legal software vendors. Legal software is about the same price as
it is in the US, but hardware is usually a lot cheaper because most of it has
been smuggled. For example: </font></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><font face="Times New Roman">Intel Pentium 200 MMX - 130$</font></li>
<li><font face="Times New Roman">MainBoard ATX (for Pentium)         - 80$</font></li>
<li><font face="Times New Roman">Intel Pentium II 233 - 220$</font></li>
<li><font face="Times New Roman">Hard Disk Caviar 3.100 GB -         170$</font></li>
<li><font face="Times New Roman">Diamond 3DFX 4MB - 140$</font></li>
<li><font face="Times New Roman">Sound Blaster 32 AWE - 60$</font></li></ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The second area of the warez market is
actually a school. During the week, children go to classes there, but on
Saturday and Sunday dealers install their computers in the gymnasium and unpack
cds with fresh warez. </font></p>
<p>Warez are sold by the meg, with most vendors charging around $15 for a CD,
or $5 per 100 MBs if you come in with your hard disk or streamer cassette. A
full cd version (not rip) of a program costs $8 The best selling releases are
English of course. Fewer groups release programs in other languages, but most
customers also prefer the original (English) versions because they include
better help files.</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Warez vendors make a hefty profit, but they're
forced to pay the police $200 a week for bribes. As a result, the police have
never inspected the market and people feel safe there. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It's a great business for everyone. Customers
get cheap warez, vendors and police make money, the school gets a bigger budget,
and almost everyone is satisfied. Of course, software companies are unhappy
(especially Microsoft), but no-one worries about them ;)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a warning that "Selling illegal
software is forbidden" written over the door, just as a formality ;)

<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#0000ff">The scene</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The third and last part of the warez market is
the area around the school. This part is reserved for computers like the Amiga,
Atari, and Spectrum (Sic!). Most people there are there as a hobby instead of a
business. People from the Polish Amiga demo scene meet there often. </font></p>
<p>Scene people hang out at the market, but none of them are really "in
the scene." You wouldn't recognize any of their nicks, they're couriers,
suppliers, crackers, and phreakers in small - local groups. Most of them rely on
ftp sites that are affiliated with other ftp sites that have more recognizable
supporters. </p>
<p>Most of the warez don't include the original nfo files. Why? Because there
aren't ANY Polish warez groups to help package warez locally. 2 years ago there
was a famous Polish group named Toxic Project (tXP) that worked with DoD and
Razor 1911. Unfortunately, tXP was closed due to inactivity, which I covered in
a previous scenelink article. </p>
<p>Despite the lack of consistent nfos, people are very ready to read them.
I've even seen an nfo joke at the warez market, which I'll try to translate:
<br> &lt;customer&gt; what new warez do you have?<br> &lt;vendor&gt; I have 2
new games and 1 new util<br> &lt;customer&gt; what exactly? <br> &lt;vendor&gt;
a rally game, a strategy game and a graphics editor<br> &lt;customer&gt; can I
buy the game, the graphics editor and the nfo file from the strategy game? I
don't like those kinds of games.</p>
<p>Ok, maybe it loses something in the translation.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#0000ff">The market's future</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">During the week the main grounds are empty,
but all around it big corporations (like Bertelsmann, Mercedes, LG.) are putting
up buildings. There are rumors that the area may be sold in the near future, but
even if that happens, the warez market will still exist because school
administrators still want to rent out rooms. It seems our warez market is
immortal ;)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Recently, the UOP (something like the CIA)
spent 3 months antagonizing vendors. The results were minimal though, because in
the end journalists discovered that agents had been taking bribes from the warez
market administration. The complete failure of the the effort was the first and
last anti piracy effort for software firms in Poland. Ever since then, nobody
complains about the warez market. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This year will be decisive for the warez
market. Optimus, Poland's largest hardware company, with help from the
monopolist telecommunication company TPSA, is organizing a big computer party
for all firms and people connected with computers. Tickets will cost around
$100, but organizers a giving warez vendors free entry. It seems that the warez
market is becoming a legend ;)</font></p>
