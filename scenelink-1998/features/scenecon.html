a monthly meet organized by nd to bring scene folks face to face, in New Jersey.
The con was less than successful. Cgeeee was kind enough to speak about the
experience...

<a href="http://www.krad.org/">scenecon website</a> says:</strong>
<font color="#252525">The idea of having scenecon came from bay and nd's
thought of pursuing a monthly meet for NJ residents... focusing strongly on the
ansi/lit/hirez/demo scenes... The whole idea is getting people together to just
do stuff, and no conference will follow a certain agenda, the Con is what you
make of it.

Why did you attend?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> Well, I heard it would be the bomb, and I was going
to NY anyways so I figured I'd go.
<br><br><b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> What happened at the
scenecon?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> IT WAS SO MUCH FUN!@#!@ It was the best time of my
life! Of course... by now you realize, I am being sarcastic.
<br><br><b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> Yes, it had occurred
to me... what went on at the con?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> Well, the truth is that no one besides me and
remorse's crew showed up.
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> I didn't actually KNOW they were there till 5 mins to
5:00 and I left at 5:00. Mainly, we bitched:)
<br><br><b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> About?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> About nd...  he didn't reply to any of our pages and
he didn't show up. Neither did anyone else. I'm extremely disappointed, he could
have at least showed up.
<br><br><b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> Do you know why he
didn't?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> Yes, because he couldn't get a RIDE TO HIS OWN CON
<br><br><b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> Has anyone talked to
him?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> He was in #ansi, he was just bitching that he
couldn't get a ride to scenecon. I dunno, I think there was a lot of deception
on his part. I'm pretty pissed...  he goofed, and didn't admit to it.
<br><br><b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> Will there be
another scene con?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> Yes...  but that one will also be canceled...
<br><br><b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> What *should* have
happened at the con?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> Lunch and scene is good... but if you can HACK INTO
GOVERNMENT FILES while at the con, that's cool too:) Its a place for people in
the scene to get together/meet/have fun...   which obviously didn't happen at
scenecon.
<br><br><b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> Why do you think no
one showed up for this con?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> Because nd is a putz, I am mad...
<br><br><b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> How do you think it
could have been organized better?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> Well, nd coulda gotten a real ride and not depended
on a crackhead... like deadpool.<br><br>
<b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> Even if nd had been there, it
would have been 4 people. Would that have been a successful con?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> No way. It woulda sucked, but at least it wouldn't be
his fault. He couldn't control such circumstances BUT he didn't even freaking
show up to his own con.
<br><br><b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> Do you think enough
people knew about the con?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> Everyone knew scenecon was going down. I woulda cut
him some slack...  if he ACTUALLY SHOWED UP but he didn't even show up so now I
can blame whatever I want on him because he didn't take responsibility.
<br><br><b><font color="#808080">[scenelink]</font></b> Closing comments?
<br><br><b>[cgeeee]</b> Cons can be cool, but don't do what nd did:)
