for news, features, release lists, a gallery, and a renewed sense of pride in
the scenes. We've worked hard to get it to this point, but whether or not the
project is successful will depend on how willing people are to participate in
something that seeks to make life in the scene better for all. Bullshit?
Possibly. <a href="scenelink.html">Read more to find out if it's as naive and

E-mag enters the scene!</strong></font><font size="2"><br> Syndication being
the only GOOD e-mag in the scene. One of the former members got tired of seeing
all of the fame go by. So I decided to start up my own e-mag called Future Scene
News(FSN), and for the first week we actually are doing pretty good on getting
members for the e-mag we can actually depend on. Since we have a lot of members
that are in other big named warez courier groups and release groups, they link
us to other friends in big groups which gives us a good amount of writers and
things to write about. If you would like to see what is going on or want to join
then just join #fsn on EFnet and talk to one of the ops. <a href="fsn.txt">View

on AFT 15</strong></font><font size="2"><br> We'll be back with another jam
packed issue of thrills and spills with Affinity 15. Just when you thought
Affinity was no longer, we're back to shove a finger in your eyes and tell you
that we never die! &lt;g&gt; Beginning with this issue, we've removed some
sections that have become redundant over the past issues. We hope to replace
those with new and more innovative sections. However, we need your input to
guide us in the right direction. <br> We've also added what we like to call,
the "Affinity Music Player." AFT-MP is a native 32bit Windows 95
application that can play music files, like those found in each issue of
Affinity, which contain an AFFINITY.DAT file. Since most issues are merely huge
executable files, I hope to implement support for those as well.. AFT-MP is
still in early beta stages and has to through some evolution before I would even
consider it remotely acceptable. Please use it with caution, some things may or
may not work.<br> Let's rock,<br> <em>Mr. Mister</em><br> Affinity

months now and will wrap up the first of the year. We have received over 50
submissions so far. The contest rules are simple. Anything goes. Color, B&amp;W,
whatever. We have a professional printing company lined up to do the actual
shirts, so complexity / color depth is not an issue. Although, we would like a
front/back design. The color of the actual t-shirts will be decided on when the
winner is picked, so all background options are open. Making submissions is
easy, just attach the graphic via email address t-shirt@drinkordie.com. The
winner gets a free t-shirt. For further<br> updates, check </font><a href="http://www.drinkordie.com/"><font size="2">www.drinkordie.com</font></a><font size="2"><em><br> The Evil Advisor</em><br> DOD Leader</font></td></tr>
