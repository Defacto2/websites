<p><b>Hi all.  This mail concerns a new bill of law passed by the United
States congress.  The bill itself can be found at
<a href="ftp://ftp.loc.gov/pub/thomas/c105/h2265.eh.txt">ftp://ftp.loc.gov/pub/thomas/c105/h2265.eh.txt</a>
and further information on it can be found by searching for bill h2265 at this

<p><b>Although not quite as sensational as ABC News made it out to be
(surprise surprise), the Act could still have a significant impact on the scene.
 For those of you that do not live in the US, such as myself, you should still
be concerned about this law, because the US is the source for most warez.  You
should also be concerned  because if the US federal authorities [in cooperation
with the Software Piracy Association (SPA), which is funded by companies with
HUGE resources that have vested interest in anti-piracy movements,] is able to
successfully enforce this law, the SPA will probably encourage local authorities
in other countries to try the same thing.  The SPA will have collected an
immense amount of data on the scene already, making it that much easier for
other countries to join in. 
</b></p><br><br><font size="+2"><tt><b>About the law</b></tt></font><br>
<p><b>Before the NET Act, US Law made it illegal to distribute copyrighted
material for profit.  The NET Act  changes the legal definition of "profit"
to include the gain of other copyrighted material, ie. trading warez/music.  So
this means that if feds can  prove that you uploaded warez somewhere, and are in
possession of warez yourself, you are committing an offense.  Broadly speaking. 
It will be interesting to see what the courts allow as proof, etc.. in the
upcoming cases. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The NET Act also raises the stakes.  If the total retail value of the
pirated material exceeds $2,500 US (ie. 10 copies of something worth $250), you
<i><em>"shall be imprisoned not more than 6 years, or fined the amount
set forth in this title, or  both..."</em></i></b>
</p>
<p><b>The law gives software companies the right to claim losses against you
which are equal in value to the "estimated economic impact" of your
activities.  Also thrown in for good measure, is an addendum to ensure a harsh
and  incompassionate sentencing - the sentencing of convicted persons under this
law should be<i><em> "sufficiently stringent to deter such a crime...
[the  sentence should] provide for consideration of the retail value and
quantity of the items..."</em></i></b>
</p>
<p><b>Clearly this is a "shoot to kill" policy, which shows the
government's intent to act on this newly constructed offense.  So I ask that you
cover your asses, whether you feel that you are at risk or not, so as not to put
others at risk.  This  includes not sending sensitive information (logins,
passwords, site IPs, etc) on irc channels or in private /msgs.  Use dcc chat,
it's a direct  connection.  This also includes protecting email messages using
strong (non-US) encryption.  Such protection can be  downloaded for free (and in
almost all languages) at: <a href="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/">http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/</a>
</b></p>
<p><em>Take care.</em></p>
