<p align="center"><img height="200" width="495" src="scenelink_files/feature.gif"></p><br><font color="#001e00"><b>Scenelink's goal is to bring together scene information to
make it easier for people to keep track of what's going on. In some ways we're
an emag, like the fact that we publish a series of articles under the features
area once a month, but our goal is to go as far beyond being just a magazine as
possible.
<br><br>Going beyond being a magazine means making scenelink into a location,
a place rather than a thing. Scenelink has the potential to become a forum for
everyone to share and discuss whatever they want, but a forum is only useful or
interesting if people take advantage of it. Before going any farther, lets just
summarize the areas of scenelink.
</b></font><br><br><font size="+1"><strong><font color="#004000">What

scenelink is:</font></strong></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> <font size="+1" color="#000040">Features:</font><font size="-1">Articles,
interviews, comics, etc published on a monthly basis. Basically like issues of a
magazine.</font></li>
<li> <font size="+1" color="#000040">Gallery:</font><font size="-1">Selections
from current art packs.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1" color="#000040">News:</font> <font size="-1">The
frontpage of the site, filled with up to the minute scene news.
</font></li>
<li><font size="+1" color="#000040">Index:</font><font size="-1"> A listing
of scene groups with their current info.</font></li>
<li> <font size="+1" color="#000040">Releases:</font> <font size="-1">A
continuously updated list of game, util, and emag releases.
</font></li></ul><br><b>The first two areas will be handled by the scenelink
staff, but everything else will be entirely dependent on cooperation with people
and groups outside scenelink. We've created the status of "cooperating
group", or "coop group,"
to make things a little more organized. Scene groups of any age or type are
eligible to sign up as a coop group, and the only requirement is that you submit
a short update (via our cgi submission page) once a month. To find out more
about being and becoming a coop group check out the coop group overview page.
Signing up as a coop group gives you a login and password for submitting info,
and puts your group's contact person on our list of people to remind when it
comes time to submit info for the index.
</b><br><br><font size="+1"><strong><font color="#004000">But what about
security?</font>
</strong></font><br><br><b>The main reason scenelink was created was because
all this information already exists, but is so spread out that it's impossible
to find. The only people with the time and persistence to keep up with the scene
are FBI agents, and they're probably the only ones who do. There are some pretty
significant questions of security that a project like scenelink raises, but most
of these can be dismissed when you consider that the information exists already,
it's just a question of making it easier for people that don't spend their time
collecting it as "evidence" to access. Moreover, with the exception of
features, every page of the site is controlled by the groups that will be
affected by that information. If a group thinks that their security is at risk,
they have the option of providing only what they feel comfortable with. This
brings up the obvious question&#8230; 
</b><br><br><font size="+1"><strong><font color="#004000">Why should people
or groups bother participating in scenelink at all?</font></strong></font><br><br><b>Groups
are already talking to the FBI in their nfos, but scenelink gives people a
chance to talk to their peers. Scenelink also gives people and groups a chance
to say MORE. An index entry is a way of summing up everything that's happened in
the month, and to note all kinds of changes that would have gone unsaid in an
nfo. In an nfo you have to get right to the point because most people don't care
very much about anything aside from the crack info, but with an index entry
you're speaking only to people that have an interest in what your group is
doing. Over the course of a month it's easy for people to remember the one fuck
up and forget about all the solid work that was done, an index entry lets you
remind them.
</b><br><br><b>Submitting announcements to the news pages lets people get the
word out immediately about something. Right now there's no good way to tell
people about something big that's just happened; by the time it's filtered into
channel topics, emags, and webpages it's probably old news already, but the
scenelink news page is instantaneous. Of course, it'll only be useful if people
regularly check the page, but whether or not that happens depends mostly on the
coop groups. If people send in info, people will check the page regularly, and
people will send info in if people check the page regularly. It's the old
chicken and egg problem, and solving it will require that groups take the
initiative. We've made it easy to participate, but now groups need to decide
whether or not it's worth it to them to do so, and in the short run it may not
be. It's up to groups and individuals to make scenelink into a forum for scene
info, if the benefits of such a forum is worth it to your group, we ask that you
show your support by signing up as a
coop group now.

</b><br><br><font size="+1"><strong><font color="#004000">I don't care what
other people think, so why should my group participate?</font></strong></font><br><br><b>Because
it's easy. Like 5 minutes per month easy. Even if you don't personally care very
much what people say, it's probably still worth 5 minutes to make your comments
known. And if you don't even care enough to do that, hopefully you give slightly
more than a fuck about the scene itself. Obviously right now the scene isn't
what it used to be. Nor should it go back, because things that worked on the
bbses at 14.4 aren't going to work now or in the future. The scene needs to go
forward a little, and the only way things are going to get improve is if people
start to communicate. Nobody has to agree, but without some sort of underlying
communication we don't have a scene, we just have a bunch of warring tribes.
Right now the only time most people ever talk to people outside their own group
is when they want to complain about a channel, release, or just bitch in
general. When it's so easy to be a part of the change, it doesn't make any sense
not to be.
</b><br><br><font size="+1"><strong><font color="#004000">Enough about
groups, why should I read scenelink?</font></strong></font><br><br><b>Read it
because it helps keep you up-to-date on what's happening in your own area of the
scene and beyond it. It's easy to miss what's happening in your own scene, and
even easier to miss what's going on in other scenes because keeping up means
checking 20 sites, 50 channels, and a 100 websites daily. Scenelink does the
work for you! We filter out all the repetitive garbage and bring you just what's
interesting. All the news comes straight from the groups involved, so it's
accurate and current. We provide a huge range of sources and levels of detail,
so you can pick out what you want to read based on what you're interested, and
hopefully because it's so easy you'll end up finding new or former interests.
</b><br><br><b>Read scenelink if you're interested in more than just what
your group is doing. On the other hand, if you think your group exists in a
vacuum untouched and unconcerned with anything else, don't bother reading
scenelink.
