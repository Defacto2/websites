we're a new mag.. made up of old rcn people... 
<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b> how are syn's goals different from what rcn's
were? 
<br><br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> We aim to be honest,
and unbiased. 
<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b> how is syn going to be similar to rcn? 
<br><br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> We will maintain an
equal if not better standard of writing, and release on the same regular basis
that early issues of rcn were released. However we don't want to be compared to
rcn. Some of us are the same people, however this is definitely not rcn part 2.

<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b> how often do you plan to release, and how will
the code be different from rcn, aft, or rev? 
<br><br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> Currently we plan on
releasing once a month, the code will be an improvement over other emag code,
simply because we have been able to look at other mags and see how the code
could be improved. How much of an improvement this code is, remains to be seen.
If all goes well then our code will be a quantum leap in scene mag coding. 
<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b> how important is it to you to release on time?
rcn, particularly towards the end of its life, was often criticized for its "don't
ask" policy on deadlines. Are you going to set deadlines a month in
advance, or will it be "wait and see"? 
<br><br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> We really care about
meeting deadlines, but we also don't wish to set deadlines and then disappoint
people by not being able to meet them. We will do our absolute best to be on
time. However we will be honest when we can't make a deadline, unlike previous
mags, that have set deadline after deadline, and let them slip by. When we can't
make it, we will be honest.
<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b> when is your next deadline? 
<br><br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> Currently we are
waiting on the code, and still busy setting things up, the first issue will
arrive as soon as possible.  
<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b> What do you think is currently the most widely
read scene emag? 
<br><br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> At one point the most
read would have been rcn, and right now, I can say I read defacto2's webpage
everyday :) 
<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b> Why choose the name Syndication? 
<br><br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> Syndication is a
brotherhood of sorts, and in this we are all friends and very close. 
<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b>  What lessons did you learn from rcn, and how is
that affecting the way SYN is published? <br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> Just things about code,
and management. 
<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b>  how can people help SYN? 
<br><br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> Submit articles.. we
always want to hear from our readership 
<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b>  any positions that need filling? 
<br><br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> Currently we are
doing fine, but writers will be needed soon 
<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b>  ok, and do you have anything to say about the
new web page? 
<br><br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> The scenelink page, I
like it a lot. 
<br><br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b>  thanks :) 
<br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b>  but I actually meant YOUR new webpage 
<br><b>[ neofish9 ]</b>  you know, the one at
<a href="http://www.syndication.org/">www.syndication.org</a>...[ g ] 
<br><br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ helter ]</font></b> hehe I like that one
too :) </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>
