<p align="left"><font size="+2"><b>T</b></font>he field of software is a
fairly new one.  About twenty years ago, people started doing lots of
programming.  There was no clear basis in tradition for whether software should
be considered property or not.  There were several possible traditions you could
consider extending by analogy to the area of software, no one of which was
inevitable, or necessarily more right than the others.  One of them was the area
of mathematics. Some people believe that a program is like a mathematical
formula, and the tradition for mathematical formulas is that they couldn't be
property.  Another thing that programs are like is recipes.  In fact, of all the
things that people encounter in daily life, the recipe is the one that's most
like a program. It's directions for getting something useful done.  And recipes,
also, by our traditions cannot be property.  There was a third thing, and that
was literature.  As it happens, literature traditionally could be property. 
Programs have something in common with all three of these things.  They don't
have more, particularly, in common with literature than they do with mathematics
or recipes, but the decision was made to treat them like literature because the
people who had the most to gain from that particular decision were allowed to
decide.  </p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">But</font> <b>this decision was not good for
society as a whole</b>.  It's incredibly destructive, and it feeds an overall
destructive tendency in this society which we can see in every area.  And that's
why, having observed the results, I came to the conclusion that it was
unacceptable, that software cannot be property, and that I would dedicate my
career to bringing that about.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">I</font>f we look at the traditional forms of
intellectual property, we can see they were all designed to fit into niches
where they could exist without doing great harm to society.  These niches were
often created by the technology that existed at the time. For example, consider
the area of books, for which copyright was invented.  At the time, books could
only be copied by mass production.  Earlier, books were copied one at a time, by
hand, and at that time there was no idea of copyright.  In fact, people didn't
even have the concept of strictly distinguishing their original book from a
non-original one.  It was a continuum. They recognized that some writers wrote
more new things into their books, while they copied passages [from other books],
or they might just be copying entire books.  All of these things were
legitimate, useful activities, though useful in different ways.  But when the
printing press was invented, it suddenly became for all intents and purposes
impossible to copy a book by hand.  Not that it was any harder than it had been
before, but by comparison with making a copy on a printing press, it was so
ridiculously impractical that no one would want to do it.  The situation where
books were made by mass production lent itself to copyright in the sense that
copyright became a restriction on one particular kind of industry---a form of
industrial regulation. It didn't take away the rights of the reading public in
any way, because members of the reading public couldn't copy books anyway. They
didn't own printing presses, so it was effectively impossible for them to copy
books.  But this niche was created by a particular technology, and changing
technology can make it go away again.  The technology of computer programs has
never been like that.</p>
<p align="left"><i><font size="+1">[</font>I have since learned that people
did copy books by hand to a significant extent after the printing press was
developed.  What I said was true in recent times, but in England in the 1500's
(and perhaps later) government-enforced featherbedding among printers made
printed books fairly expensive; as a result, poor people might more easily
afford the time to copy a book than the price of the book.  But these people
were not prosecuted for copying or told it was wrong.  Copyright was applied
only to authors and publishers.  It was treated as an industrial regulation.<font size="+1">]</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">I</font>n the time that I've worked as a
programmer, I've watched things change from a situation where people generally
shared work and generally used work that had been done in whatever way was
useful, to one in which is nearly impossible to utilize work that other people
have done, where people feel uncomfortably cynical. Constantly, a person will
describe a great piece he's doing that's so exciting, you ask him will I be able
to use it?'', and his face falls, and he says, no, you probably won't be, and he
realizes that he's doing something wrong, but he perhaps doesn't have the
commitment to doing right that would be required to decide that he wasn't going
to do it any more.  But that kind of thing <i><font size="+1">[</font>doing
what they know is wrong and being too scared to stop<font size="+1">]</font></i>
demoralizes people.
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">I</font>f we look at the two arguments that
are advanced most often toward intellectual property in software, they are one,
the
<strong>emotional</strong> argument, and two, the <strong>economic</strong>
argument.  The
<em>emotional argument</em> goes something like, </p>
<p align="left"> <strong>I put my sweat, and my heart, into this program. 
It's my soul; it comes from me,
<font size="+1"><b>it's mine!</b></font>.<b><font size="+1">''</font></b></strong>
 </p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">W</font>ell, it's sort of fishy that most of
these people would then go sell it to a company.  And what ever happened to
egoless programming, anyway?  So I don't really think that that argument is
worth refuting any harder than that.  It's a feeling that people can cultivate
when it suits them, not one that is inevitable.  By comparison, consider all the
great artists and artisans of medieval times, who usually didn't even sign their
names.  They didn't consider that it was relevant who had done the work, only
that it existed; and this was the way people thought for hundreds of years. </p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">T</font>he <em>economic argument</em> goes
something like, </p>
<p align="left"><strong>I want to get rich (except that I'll call that make a
living'), and if you don't allow me to get rich by programming, then I won't
program.  And then you'll be screwed---<b><font size="+1">so there! </font></b><font size="+1"><b>''</b></font> </strong> </p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">W</font>ell, I'll explain later why I think we
don't have to go along with that kind of blackmail.  But first I want to address
the claim [I should have said, the implicit assumption] that society actually
benefits from proprietary software development.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">T</font>he first problem with that argument is
that it's comparing the wrong two things [owned software vs no software]. 
Certainly, software development is useful.  But to link the development of the
software with subsequent ownership and prevention of use is to beg the question.
 The question is, Should software development be linked with some ability to
stop people from using it?'', and in order to decide this, we have to judge the
effects of each of those two activities independently.  What I intend to show is
that the effects of ownership, by itself, are very destructive, and therefore,
if you want to encourage the development which is useful, we should not connect
it with something destructive [like ownership].  And I'll go on to explain other
ways in which this <i><font size="+1">[</font>encouragement<font size="+1">]</font></i>
can easily be done.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">L</font>et's look at the overall effects of
software ownership. Consider that we have a program that has been developed, and
now it either can be free, or it can be proprietary.  There are three different
levels of material harm that come from making it proprietary.  And with each of
these, there's a concomitant form of spiritual harm.  By spiritual'' I mean the
effect on people's feelings, attitudes, and thoughts of the actions that they
take.  These changes in people's ways of thinking will then have a further
effect on their actions in the future.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">T</font>he <strong>first</strong> level is
the level of simple use of a program.  If a program is successfully made
proprietary, that will cause fewer people to use it.  This doesn't make it any
less work, however. Here is a crucial difference between programs and cars,
chairs, or sandwiches.  That is, once there's one of them, anyone can
essentially snap his fingers and have as many more copies of the thing as are
wanted.  This isn't true for material objects, which are conserved, and which
have to be built in the same way that the first one was built.  With material
objects, it's not necessarily destructive to have a price on them because that
means if people decide to buy fewer of them, you can make fewer of them and use
fewer resources and spend less of your time.  You might say, Well, these people
only want to pay for ten of these, so I'll build ten and I'll spend the rest of
the day going fishing.''  But that's not relevant when the question is whether
they should build some more themselves, which is what users will do with free
programs.  So we find that there's no overall benefit which comes<b>---</b>no
non-selfish, non-obstructive reason to want to put a price on the use<b>---</b>why
have a disincentive to use something which really costs nothing to make<b>?</b>
 A great spiritual harm goes along with this waste, because of the way it's
worked.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">T</font>he spiritual harm comes from the
nondisclosure agreements and licenses that people sign, because each buyer is
asked to betray his neighbors.  If you want to use a program and your neighbor
wants to use the program, the Golden Rule says that you should want both of you
to get that program.  You shouldn't aim for a solution where you get it and the
other people don't, if you want to be a good citizen, that is.  And the
nondisclosure agreement essentially says I promise to be a bad citizen<b>---</b>I
promise to say To hell with my neighbors<b>!</b>'  To hell with everyone<b>!</b>
 Just give me a copy<b>!</b>''.  And you can see the spiritual effect that has
on the community you live in.
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">A</font> lot of people unconsciously recognize
this and that's why the decide to share programs anyway.  But they feel somewhat
guilty because they haven't reasoned it out carefully and decided that the
nondisclosure agreements are illegitimate morally.  They know that they must
break those agreements in order to be still friends with their friends, but they
still think that the agreements are valid also, and so they feel ashamed of
being friends with their friends.  And that's also a kind of spiritual harm. 
<b>I say that people shouldn't have to explain in a slightly embarrassed tone
of voice that they're pirates''</b>.  They shouldn't think of themselves as
pirates.  They shouldn't use that particular propoganda term. </p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">T</font>he <strong>second</strong> level of
material harm is at the level of adapting programs.  Most commercially available
software isn't fully available, even commercially.  It's available for you to
take it or leave it, but it's not available for you to change. But changing
programs is an incredibly useful thing, and if that is prevented, it's a great
harm.  I have a friend who told me that she worked as a programmer in a bank for
about six months, writing a program that was pretty close to something that was
commercially available, and she thought that if she could have gotten source
code for that commercially available program, it would have taken much less than
six months to adapt it to their needs.  But they couldn't get the source code,
so she had to do a lot of make-work, a lot of work that you would include in the
GNP but was really totally useless.  And I'm sure you've all had the experience
as programmers of being frustrated because there was a program you wanted to
change and couldn't.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">W</font>e can consider what it would be like
if recipes were hoarded in the same fashion as software.  You'd say, How do I
change this recipe to put in less salt<b>?</b>'', and the great chef says, How
dare you insult my recipe, the child of my brain, by trying to tamper with it<b>?</b>
 You don't have the judgement to tamper with my recipe and make it work right<b>!</b>''.
 But my doctor says I'm not supposed to eat salt!  What do I do<b>?</b>''. 
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">T</font>he spiritual harm that comes from this
is to the spirit of self-reliance, which used to be greatly valued in this
country. If you can't be self-reliant, then the landscape that you live in is
frozen under someone else's control and you can't change it. That leads to a
demoralized attitude like Well, yeah, this system isn't really what we want, but
it's hopeless to think of trying to change it, so we'll just have to live with
it and suffer and suffer and suffer.''  And nothing can kill morale of
programmers like that.  </p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">I</font> remember even at MIT we had an
example like that, and I remember how it demoralized people.  Our first graphics
printer was the XGP, which many of you are probably lucky enough not to have
heard of.  But that was available ten years ago or more. And all the software
for that was written at MIT, and we could change it.  We put in lots of nice
features, such as it would send you a message when your document had actually
been printed; and it would a send you a message if you had anything queued and
there was a paper jam; and many other nice features.  Then later we got
something called the Dover, which was another gift from Xerox.  But there, the
software was proprietary, and it ran in a separate computer that served as the
spooler, and we couldn't add any of those features.  So when you got a message
that said your document has been sent'', you don't know if it's been printed,
you won't find out when it's been printed, and no one would get informed when
there was a paper jam, so it might sit there with no one fixing it for an hour. 
And we all knew that we were capable of fixing these things, probably as well as
the original authors were, but somebody found it useful to sabotage us.  <em>That
was a constant source of frustration.</em></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">T</font>he <strong>third</strong> level of
material harm is the level of software development.  Software development used
to go on by a sort of evolutionary process, where a person would take a program
and rewrite parts of it for one new feature, and then another person would
rewrite parts to put another new feature in; this could go on over twenty years.
 The final program might have many features that the original one didn't have,
but you might still see a few lines of code that you could recognize by their
style as having been there from ten years before without ever being changed. 
And one of the main goals of intellectual property is to prevent this kind of
evolution, to try to make it impossible for you to throw together a program
quickly and easily by cannibalizing things that are already written.  In any
kind of intellectual field, progress is built by standing on the shoulders of
others.  That's what's no longer allowed---you can only stand on the shoulders
of the other people in your company nowadays.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">A</font>nd the spirit that's harmed by this
material harm is the spirit of scientific cooperation, which used to be so
strong that scientists would cooperate with each other even when they were in
countries that were at war.  Nationalism wasn't able to destroy scientific
cooperation, but greed has.  Nowadays, people don't publish enough in their
papers to be able to replicate anything. They publish only enough for you to be
able to gaze in amazement at how much they had been able to do.</p>
<p align="left"><i><font size="+1">[</font>Tape counter 213-227: someone
describes the example of   Karmarkar's algorithm, an efficient algorithm for
linear   programming that AT&amp;T is keeping secret.<font size="+1">]</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">S</font>o now that I have shown all these
reasons why ownership of software is bad for society, I think the conclusion
that we shouldn't allow or recognize in any way a concept such as ownership of
programs.  We should say that programs are not property, and if we want to
encourage software development, we should encourage it in another way.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">T</font>here are many fields in which no one
sees a way to get rich by owning something and no one expects to, but there are
still lots of people eager to work in the field.  They compete bitterly, though
more sadly than bitterly, I guess, for the few funded positions available, none
of which is funded very much.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">S</font>uddenly, however, when it becomes
possible by hoarding information to get rich, you find people saying that no one
will work in the field if they can't get rich.  Well, it may be true at that
moment, but it's a consequence of the expectation that you can get rich. 
Therefore, we shouldn't assume that it has to be true in any particular field. 
It's essentially a coincidence that that field makes it possible to get rich by
hoarding, and if we were to take away the possibility of getting rich by
hoarding, then after a while, when the people had intellectually readjusted,
they would once again be eager to work in the field for the joy of working in
it, and they would ask us only to provide them a pittance to live on.  And these
pittances can be provided at universities which right now are proprietary
software sellers.  They can be supported by hardware manufacturers which have to
do software development anyway, and twenty years ago did free software
development.  They can be supported by government contracts and grants, which
actually support a lot of proprietary software development today.  A large
amount of software development is supported one way or another by the military,
some of which may have to do with building weapons, but not all of it; but it's
proprietary anyway, most of the time.  
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">S</font>ome people I know right now have a
contract to write a proprietary, improved version of a free program that
supports TCP/IP on IBM PC's.  And with this contract, they could make a living
just as well writing free software, but of course they're not going to; they
want to be able to clean up afterwards.  And you all know of people who get
research grants to develop something at a university, and then they make the
unfinished version free, and go on to start companies to sell something with the
last few finishing touches, so that you'd actually want to use it. </p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">O</font>ur whole world, everywhere we look,
all forms of good will to your neighbor are being undermined by the search for
ways to obstruct for profit.  Fifty years ago, various people in the Mafia would
go around to stores in the neighborhood and say You have a nice building there;
it would be a shame, wouldn't it, if it burned down, and there have been a lot
of fires around here lately.  I think you need some protection''.  And this was
called the protection racket''.  Now we have people going to computer users and
saying, You've got some nice software there, but I paid those congressmen to say
it's illegal for you to have it.  A lot of people have been going to jail around
here lately for that.  You wouldn't want to go to jail, would you?  I think you
need to pay me some money.''  And this is the software protection racket.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">T</font>hey say that they're providing a
useful service to the public, that they are software publishers, or software
stores.  But these functions only appear to be necessary because of the
restrictions they have managed to place on us.  You wouldn't need a software
store if software were free.  You'd only need the public library, which would
have a computer with copies that you could download, or copy onto floppies or
tapes, of one copy of all the programs that you'd want.  And it wouldn't cost
very much<b>---</b>nothing, compared with what software stores cost to run, to
make this thing go.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">B</font>ut the people in the Mafia fifty years
ago didn't want to admit to themselves---they wanted to pretend to themselves
that there was something legitimate about what they were doing, and that's why
they phrased it in terms of protection.  They didn't bluntly say I'll burn your
store down if you don't pay me.<em>''  So, too, the software publishers like to
pretend, and speak as if they were doing something useful, instead of simply
saying if you use that program, I'll send some cops after you if you don't pay
me.''</em></p>
<p align="left"><i><font size="+1">[</font>Unintelligible question,
apparently about if there are     sufficient programmers to write software w/o
monopolies.     Ans:<font size="+1">]</font></i>
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">W</font>ell how do you know they're not
sufficient?  So much of software work today is wasted by duplication that's done
only for proprietary reasons, we could probably get as much software delivered
with half the programmers if we didn't have this form of featherbedding.  In
fact, it's sort of funny to look at the quest for software productivity.  There
are two meanings you could have for software productivity.  You can look at the
software productivity of the industry as a whole, or you could ask about the
productivity of a particular company.  There's a lot of work being put into
increasing the software productivity of particular companies one by one, but the
best way to increase the productivity of the whole industry is to eliminate the
artificial obstruction.  And that would increase productivity far more than
anything people are trying to do now.  But they don't want that, because what
they want is productivity of my company, not productivity that actually benefits
society.  But they use that language to try make people overlook the difference.
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">I</font>t's an interesting thing about how
language is used for propoganda.  By choosing particular words, you don't force
people to think a certain way, but you can strongly suggest certain avenues of
thought.  By using a certain word for two things, you can bias people without
their knowing it towards seeing the similarities and underestimating the
differences.  And this is one of the reasons why software hoarders use the terms
property rights'' and ownership'' and theft'' while I use the term software
hoarding''.  Software hoarding is my name for the crime of trying to prevent
someone else from sharing a program with a third party.  And that's the same
thing that's going on with <em>"software productivity"</em>. 
Software productivity has two meanings, about which you would say different
things, but it takes a critical eye to realize that there are two meanings.  If
you don't look critically, you might say Ah!  Improving productivity<b>---</b>that's
got to be what we need!  Obviously, what we want to do to make society work
better is improve productivity!''.  You wouldn't guess that they're talking
about a very narrow kind of productivity, and excluding something that comes
into the overall productivity, an area where they themselves are deliberately
making things worse.  </p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">W</font>hat can we say, I guess, about the
overall effect of technology on these kinds of restrictions?  I've explained how
copyright pretty much made sense.  It was only a small restriction on people's
freedom in the technological situation in which it was invented.  But now we've
seen a change in technology which makes copying things one at a time a feasible
way to copy, and anyone can do it as well as anyone else, which changes the
fundamental situation that made copyright legitimate and caused it to become
illegitimate.  Right now we've seen half of that transformation in the copying
of books.  You can xerox a book now, but only for very expensive books would you
want to, because what you get is not as nice as a bound book, and it takes you
more work to do it.
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"> I</font>t fundamentally does cost more <em>(now)</em>
to make a book by xeroxing than it does on a printing press.  And it costs the
individual more, so we've only seen a few situations in which people wanted to
make any number of copies of a book by xeroxing.  But that's just a transient
state, because soon we're going to have wonderful computer printers, and we're
going to have digitizers<b>---</b>scanners, and it will be possible to scan any
book quickly, you'll have a robot to turn the pages, and have it on your disk,
and send it across a network to be printed out into a beautifully bound copy,
and at that time, book publishers will be just as useless to society as software
publishers are.  And at that time, the move that's already afoot to eliminate
the public libraries or tax them with royalties, may essentially complete
itself.  You may be unable to get a copy of a book without signing a license of
some sort.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">I</font>n general, the entire thrust of
information technology is that information is completely interconvertible.  Any
form can be changed into any form.  Nothing is ever lost.  And also, the whole
idea of the computer is that it's a universal machine. It's a machine that can
be programmed to simulate any other machine.  Why is this better than building a
specific machine? It's because you can change the program, because you can copy
the program, load in new programs.  The ability to copy and the ability to
change a program are the entire basis for the usefulness of the computer.  And
those are precisely what the software owners don't want the public to be able to
do.  Software owners want to reserve all the benefits of computer technology to
themselves, with only a trickle down'' to the public.  I say the public should
not allow this.  If we call the bluff of the programmers or the programming
investors, they won't have as many Porsches and they won't eat as much sushi. 
But once they are willing to go along with that, they'll find that there are
other ways of organizing businesses that are less profitable, but enough for a
good number of programmers to make a living nonetheless.  And we'll take a great
step forward toward a world in which it's much easier to make a living, because
there won't be as obstruction going on, making us do unnecessary work. And we'll
see all sorts of indirect effects, because society is pretty well linked.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">S</font>oftware hoarding is one form that the
tendency to obstruct society for profit takes; one that pertains to our field,
but that actually exists in some other fields as well, to greater or lesser
extents.  And the more people see this going on, the more are going to be
inclined to do so themselves when they get a chance, and the more they're going
to be demoralized and willing to put up with it, and not fight against it when
they encounter it in others.  But conversely, any time we take a stand against
some of ownership because it makes the whole world poorer, we'll help other
people stand up in the future, and we'll help spread the idea that you should
ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.</p>
<p><font size="+2"><b><strong>[QUESTIONS]  </strong></b></font></p>
<p><cite><font size="+1"><b>Q:</b></font> Your talk is very impressive, it's
almost like a sermon...
<br><font size="+1"><b>RMS:</b></font> Yes, it is.  <br><br><font size="+1"><b>Q:</b></font>
and it's difficult to put all the pieces together and argue with it, but I find
it especially difficult to see how your alternative system would work, or even
exactly how you imagine it to function.  Let me you this: you didn't mention
music.  You mentioned recipes and other things. <br> <font size="+1"><b>RMS:
</b></font>yes. <br><br><font size="+1"><b> Q:</b></font> But music is an
interesting analog also, with the score; because the composers have a union, and
everything, and they not only---  
<br><font size="+1"><b>RMS:</b></font> It supports them very poorly. 
Copyright as a way to support composers or musicians is a flop.  We should throw
it away and get something new.  We're the only advanced country that still
relies on that.  
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Q:</b></font> Well, the question I wanted to ask
you---I realize it doesn't work very well, but they hope that they can get some
profit from the publication of the printed score, but also if a producer of say,
a Broadway show, or a movie maker, makes a big profit by performing the
composer's work, then the composer would like to have a piece of that action
too.  And you can make an analogy between that and a user of software.  <br><font size="+1"><b>RMS:</b></font> You can, and I think in both cases you get
problems further down the line.  See, the nature of knowledge, and information
in general, is to make use of it, you transform it, and mix it in with other
things.  And to try to keep track of how much of a big program was developed by
this author, and how much by this person and so on, it fundamentally can't be
done unless you forbid them to work together, which is what the current system
effectively does.  It's perfectly possible to keep straight which company
developed something when nothing can ever go from one company to another.  And
that's a tremendous harm.   The whole idea of encouraging the development of
information seems plausible because the information is useful.  But in order for
it to be fully useful,  you have to abandon the idea of trying to keep track of
who created it, because any component could be created in many stages.   Now
it's true it doesn't do very much harm to anyone if this Broadway producer pays
some money to the composer, assuming that there was only one composer (of
course, there's such a thing as the folk process, and there's the process of
arrangement as well), but it just happened, I guess, that in music there
wouldn't normally be so many stages of transformation of one work that it was
hard to keep track of.  And part of the reason is that fundamentally, the value
of music is aesthetic, and therefore originality wasn't imposed simply for the
sake of intellectual property, it was valued for its own sake because something
that was not new was not aesthetically up to contribution.  A piece that was
made by cannibalizing  parts of a few other pieces with a little bit that was
new wouldn't turn music listeners on very much; they'd just say oh, yeah!  Well,
I remember that, I've heard that before in so-and-so's work.'' And in an area
where originality has an intrinsic usefulness, you won't get things being tacked
on by one person, and another, and gradually changed around so much, although in
some areas of music you do---in folk music, that's what happens [originality is
not the main concern in folk music].  And when there are fewer people changing a
work, it becomes less of an odious burden to try to keep track of who did it,
and if you're talking about in particular, the Broadway producer, well, he's
running a big business anyway, and he can arrange to make a license and so on,
so in that situation it doesn't do very much harm.   There's a danger when
somebody says that something is wrong with a significant part of
society---there's a certain problem that you run into, which is that on one
side, there are people who call you a fanatic,  and on the other side there are
people who call you inconsistent.  If you look for every ramification of the
problem you see and demand that they all be completely excised from society,
people call you a fanatic.  And if you don't look for every ramification and
demand that it be excised from society, people call you inconsistent.   What I
believe is that no one coordinate patch will map the whole world very
effectively.  There are many phenomena; each phenomenon is the controlling
phenomenon in some areas and insignificant in others.  I'm concerned with
eliminating intellectual property mainly in the field of software, because there
I see it really uglifying society and causing tremendous waste.  If it doesn't
cause so much waste in the area of music, then I don't feel it's so important to
change it there. Although, there are certain areas where I object to it, and you
can see the battle is shaping up again because of the ability of individuals to
copy.   You may have heard of the proposed laws to tax recorders and tax tape,
and pay the money to record companies, or to musicians, in proportion to their
sales.  Well, I'd be happy to see a tax on tape or tape recorders to support
musicians, but not in proportion to their sales!  If your goal is to help the
struggling musicians (and most musicians are really struggling, because our
current copyright system doesn't support them at all), I'd say that that tax
should go to the musicians who make a few sales, but not very many.  Because the
ones who make a lot are rich, and they don't need a handout.  
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Q:</b></font> I'm not sure of the legal changes
you're proposing.  There's at least three ways in which software can be
proprietary.   One is copyright laws, which you're obviously against.  <br><font size="+1"><b>RMS:</b></font> yes.  <br><br><font size="+1"><b>Q:</b></font>
Another is by entering into a contract: I promise not to copy, I promise not to
disassemble, I promise to be a bad citizen.  The third is you can use encryption
methods, which perhaps our copyright laws, hardware manufacturers support in the
processor ID [???].  My question is this:  are you proposing to make entering
into certain kinds of contracts illegal, and are you proposing to make
encrypting in order to hoard software illegal?  
<br><font size="+1"><b>RMS:</b></font> Well, I haven't seen hardware copy
protection schemes that manage to win.  Encryption, I agree, can prevent you
from changing a program, but I don't see how it can prevent you from copying it,
because you could copy the encrypted thing.  <br><br><font size="+1"><b>Q:</b></font>
but you're still avoiding the question... [not true; that was one half of the
question] <br><font size="+1"><b>A:</b></font> I would say that a
nondisclosure agreement like that should be called unenforceable, like gambling
debts.  Clearly to try to stop people from keeping secrets would be tyrannical
and I wouldn't be in favor of trying to do that. The other thing to realize is
that trade secrecy is not fully built on those contracts.  Those contracts are
one step you go through to establish something as a trade secret.  But there's
an entire body of trade secret law that imposes things on people who have not
signed those contracts.  So in that area, just as in the other areas of
copyright and patents, there's explicit government intervention which has
nothing to do with voluntary contracts, to give power to software hoarders, and
if that were taken so that we had nothing but the voluntary contracts, we'd have
a lot less power in trade secrecy than we do now.  
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Q:</b></font> One other question.  Sometimes you
seem very concerned about the [??] of software.  But when it comes to, for
instance, supporting musicians, you seem to be saying [????]  
<br><font size="+1"><b>RMS:</b></font> The public is already supporting those
musicians, and they will make a lot of money anyway, from their concerts and so
on.  And what I'm saying is that obviously, we should only have a tax like that
if people think it's desirable. Maybe people think it's desirable to support
starting musicians, and musicians whose lives are marginal but who some people
like. And I think you could set that up in such a way that only a person who was
yearning to be a musician would consider it attractive, and therefore you
wouldn't have to worry about someone sponging off of it in order to get out of
doing any work.  
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Q:</b></font> While I sympathize with the
position you've laid out, it reminds of the debate between capitalism and
communism.  <br><font size="+1"><b>RMS:</b></font> Oh, no, it's very
different.  I'll explain to you the difference.  <br><br><font size="+1"><b>Q:</b></font>
OK, well, the specific point I'd like you to explain then is that while
communism is appealing, it removes some basic human incentives that are based on
self-interest.  <br>
<font size="+1"><b>RMS:</b></font> There are lots of kinds of self-interest,
and what they are depends on the social situation.  There are also lots of kinds
of competition.  For example, there was competition among hackers in the old
days, for who could do a better program, or could make a program shorter and
faster.  That competition, though, didn't involve obstruction; yet it motivated
people very powerfully, and you can see in many areas of life where people are
motivated by a wish to excel their rivals, to do better than anyone else had
done.  And they might even spend gigantic amounts trying to do this.  Have you
read about the people who were competing to visit all the countries in the world
first?  They spent incredible amounts of money trying to do that.  But as for
the fundamental question, communism and capitalism are similar in that they're
very concerned with how much money should each person get?''. Capitalism the
position of a person who says I want to have the power to get all the money that
my might can bring me'', whereas communism says everyone should have the same
amount of money, or everybody should have an amount of money that's totally
determined by what that person needs in some sense.  But what I'm saying is, we
all have to pay less attention to how much money each of us has, because we're
impoverishing each other by paying too much attention to it.  <i><font size="+1">[</font>TAPE ENDS.<font size="+1">]</font></i></cite></p>
