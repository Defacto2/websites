        after 17 months did amnesia decide to quit?</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> <font face="Arial" size="3"> Well the group had been around in
        the scene and certain things happened that made the group
        suffer... The council decided that it would be better to
        just retire the group after our 2 months of idleness.
        Everyone had their own problems... Things just slowly
        fell apart and people stopped working. I had work, others
        had their personal problems. Amnesia had been around for
        a long while by group standards and everyone really
        slacked off and kicked back for a while. (some did not
        but for most cases)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; ok, that
        makes sense... sounds a bit like most groups. But lots of
        groups idle for months, razor&#8217;s a good example. Why
        didn't amnesia do likewise?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> Well we had
        idled for a while and nobody really cared to get things
        moving again. We had rebuilt amnesia numerous times and
        it just got old. Amnesia wasn&#8217;t like it was in the
        beginning and Lester and the rest of us decided to pull
        the plug</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> Amnesia was
        right up there in risc's face for a long time though,
        don&#8217;t forget the amnesia legacy</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; what was
        the major difference between amnesia and risc?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> Well risc
        has always had all the "big sites".. We worked
        from a disadvantage and we kicked some ass anyways.. Many
        of the people who are in risc today came from Amnesia in
        the beginning. If you look at the scene today you cant
        name a single courier group that hasn&#8217;t had some
        kind of influence from Amnesia</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; why did
        they move from amnesia to risc, besides just the prestige
        factor of working in a more established group?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> Well there
        were always factors.. Fights was one of the big problems
        early on... The maturity factor lacked at times hell I
        was one of the worst fighters around hehe.. Also a group
        like risc has their shell boxes and sites to bribe good
        couriers with.. But we looked past all of this shit and
        stuck to business and competed on a week to week basis</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; how do
        you think Amnesia did, overall?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> We were the
        best bbs couriers in the world, risc could never take
        that away from us and we had a damn fine net team as
        well... there are many times where amnesia could have
        been considered the #1 couriering group through out its
        existence</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; why did
        amnesia focus so much on the bbs side of things, and how
        do you think that focus affected the way the group
        operated?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> We focused
        equally on both sides of the trading business.. The net
        side is a bit more of a pain in the ass from my
        experience to compete on.. That and our bbs couriers were
        the best and they stuck with us and never gave up</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; do you
        think that more bbs courier groups will rise up, or is it
        just going to keep getting more and more centered on the
        sites and offer channels?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> The days of
        the bbs are numbered.. Most groups couriering/games/utils
        have all dropped the bbs due to inaccessibility. If you
        think about it where would you rather trade.. to
        somewhere you have to use calling cards and take
        unnecessary risks to courier to or to just dialup that
        isp and telnet trade with your super fast .se shell box</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; what
        about telnet?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> We had some
        telnet boards and some dialup boards.. But even telnet
        boards cant compare to sites with atm or oc3 where
        couriers get steady 800k/sec file transfers. Somewhere
        along the line the scene shifted and decided that bbs's
        were too much a hassle and decided ftps are the solution</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; what will
        you miss about amnesia?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> Oh man
        that&#8217;s a big one.. gimme a min:)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> I would have
        to say that I&#8217;m going to miss the good times we had
        and the competition and asskickings we distributed.
        Amnesia was a true courier legacy. I have a lot of
        friends from amnesia and we are still going to hang out
        and screwaround like we always have. I'll miss the name
        Amnesia because it has come to mean something in my
        vocabulary like it has the rest of the loyal members who
        stuck with the group through thick and thin</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; what do
        you think it takes to be a "legacy" and which
        groups have it, and which never got it?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> Well, to be
        a legacy a group has to have accomplished something
        great. We were the best bbs couriers in the world and one
        of the best net groups that hit the scene. Amnesia
        produced some of the best couriers that hit the world and
        a lot of other groups cant say that for themselves.
        I&#8217;m not going to go into gossiping about other
        groups because its not my position to rate them for what
        they are. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> Some people
        try to be the best.. some succeed and some fail its that
        simple</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; in what
        ways did amnesia fail, or did it?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> We failed in
        becoming an idle group that talks shit and does nothing..
        We decided things weren&#8217;t working so we canned it
        and have decided to go our separate ways. I don&#8217;t
        think we failed at meeting any of our goals and I am damn
        proud to have been part of the team.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; what did
        amnesia do to help the scene, and what do you think new
        kids in the scene will hear about amnesia years from now?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> We were the
        one of the elite trading groups. Like I said before if
        you take a look around there is no group in the scene
        that doesn&#8217;t have some kind of roots that originally
        started from amnesia. Who knows what will come out from
        the group we called Amnesia&#8230; Some day someone may
        start it back up again.. maybe it will be forgotten who
        knows, but I do know that I was a part of the original
        Amnesia and wouldn&#8217;t have missed it for anything.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; any
        advice to people starting courier groups today?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> Well, a lot
        of the new groups in the scene today (I&#8217;m talking
        about courier groups) are pretty pathetic when you look
        back to what groups like amnesia risc and empire a year
        ago.. New groups lack the talent that was once plentiful
        a year or 2 ago. My advice would be don&#8217;t bite off a
        piece you cant chew.. If you are going to start a new
        group make it good or don&#8217;t make it at all.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; are any
        of the former amnesia leaders going to be moving to
        leadership positions in other groups?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> Well, Lester
        is pretty busy being a leader in LND.. Not sure where
        exactly Davngol stands these days because I don&#8217;t
        see him a whole lot. 1 or 2 members have gone to empire
        which is kinda funny because they have already died once
        and are working on number 2. I am pleased where I stand
        in X-Force.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&lt; <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>&lt;neofish9&gt;</strong></font> &gt; how would
        you feel about a new amnesia, and what would convince you
        to join, if anything?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> Well, in the
        future I don&#8217;t see a new group under the name
        amnesia being able to accomplish what we did so I would
        have to pass up something like that. The leadership
        decided that there wouldn&#8217;t be a new amnesia and I
        agree with them.. We want the name Amnesia to be
        remembered as the group that took on the rest and kicked
        some ass doing it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> There have
        been rumors about there being a new amnesia</font></p>

        isn&#8217;t going to be a new amnesia.. Lets say if lester
        started a new group it isn&#8217;t a new amnesia.. Amnesia
        is retired and everyone is moving their separate ways</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>&lt;_TGK_&gt; </strong></font> Some people
        should be mentioned for making an outstanding effort to
        the group.. Lester was the leader and he dealt with
        everyone&#8217;s crap for a really long time gotta toss
        him some credit.. Prozac Mayhem Snapz Mimage Denial and
        probably 50 other people I&#8217;m not thinking of at the
        moment never failed to stick with the group when the shit
        hit the fan and kept on working</font></p>
