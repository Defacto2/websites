me if you fit this description.</strong> <font color="#000000"><tt>You got
your net account several months ago. You have been surfing the net, and you
laugh at those media reports of the information superhighway. You have a red
box, you don't have to pay for phone calls. You have crackerjack, and you have
run it on the password file at a unix you got an account on. Everyone at your
school is impressed by your computer knowledge, you are the one the teachers ask
for help. Does this sound like you<font size="+1">?</font></tt></font><br>

<p align="right"><font color="#000080" size="+2">You are not a hacker</font>.
</p>
<p><strong>There are thousands of you out there</strong>. You buy <b><font color="#000080">2600</font></b> and you ask questions. You read <i><b>phrack</b></i>
and you ask questions. You join <cite><font size="+1">#hack</font></cite> and
you ask questions. You ask all of these questions, and you ask what is wrong
with that<font size="+1"><strong>?</strong></font> After all, to be a hacker
is to question things, is it not<em>?</em> <tt>But, you do not want knowledge.
You want answers</tt>. You do not want to learn how things work. <em>You want
answers.</em> You do not want to explore. All you want to know is the answer to
your damn questions.
<br><br><font size="+2"><b><font color="#400080">You are not a hacker</font></b></font>.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Hacking is not about answers</font></strong>.
Hacking is about the path you take to find the answers. If you want help, don't
ask for answers, ask for a pointer to the path you need to take to find out
those answers for yourself. <em>Because it is not the people with the answers
that are the hackers</em>, <font color="#ff0000">it is the people that are
travelling along the path</font>.
