        packrat's coding of the viewer. I cant recall how many
        times I combed through the data file comparing cheats and

        easily. Cracks, patches, and most other small files need
        the files to be extracted and used, whereas the cheats
        can remain more or less monolithic. While the cheats
        database could be very easily adapted in its current

        Turned out it wasn't even anything I'd done. The
        sleepless part was mainly due to cybacolt and another
        friend sitting behind me for 8 hours while I worked on it
        sniggering and making smart comments. Neither of them, I
