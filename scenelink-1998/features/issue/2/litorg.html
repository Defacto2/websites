E-Mags,         Zines, whatever. Our goal is to have a central place

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Basically, a lot of         groups already had
domains but because lit groups tend to         be a lot smaller than the art
groups, it's harder to         pay the domain fee. Lit.org is a place for groups
that         can't afford their own domain, but want their site         to be
scene related. It's an alternative to         "www.geocities.com/are51/02930293483049."</font></p>

more or less         condemned it as an art form</font><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#808080"><strong>1</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="4">. By naming it Lit.Org and hosting         some of the
biggest art sites, its like a big F*CK You         Art boy. A lot of the people
who work on lit.org and         those who support it are artists&#8230; and as a
general         rule, they support us lit people, like by helping us find       
 other writers, or by illustrating our work. Lit.org is a         fine mixture
of all the scene forms.</font></td></tr>

central place for people to download the         "acidview" and other

say this is the biggest change for the         site so far. We have to pay for
this speed, but its not a         lot and it gives us 100% Control in a Linux
Environment.         This means we can offer full cgi access, autoresponders,   
     web boards, counters, and anything else that will help us         make the
site better. We also now have an UNLIMITED         storage capacity. Ftp.lit.org
is our anonymous ftp site,         which we hope will become one of the biggest
collections         of zines and scene packs out there.</font></td></tr>

note,</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="3"> Lit.Org was offering free web
space to         ANYONE who wanted them, I'm afraid we can no longer do        
that. Each Shell/FTP/WWW account costs US 15$ to create         (this is the fee
from our host). If anyone is interested         in having your pages up here,
Simply pay the 15 bucks,         and it gets you 1 FULL Shell account to use for
ftp, www         and pop3 e-mail. This is a ONE TIME setup fee and Lit.ORg      
  NEVER SEES the money! We will be trying to buy a few         accounts to give
away in some up coming contests that we         intend to host.</font>
