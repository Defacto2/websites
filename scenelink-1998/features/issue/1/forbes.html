<td>Mutant is the first link in an electric chain                 of
distribution that winds its way through the                 warez world, a
highly structured, hierarchical                 net-based community that,
according to BSA, the                 Business Software Alliance, costs software
makers                 $4 billion every year--one-third the world piracy        
        total. Globally, as the watchdog organization's                 web site
reminds visitors, that translates into                 $355 a second, $21,300 a
minute, more than a                 million an hour and $215 million a week.
SPA, the                 Software Publishers Association, weighs in with        
        its estimate that $5 million worth of software is

Poland stocked                 with 100 percent pirated merchandise, may get    
            more press and drain twice as much away from                
industry coffers, it's the net potential                 that chills software
executives. As BSA Vice                 President Bob Kruger states on the BSA
web site,                 the growth in the number of Internet users is         
       creating a huge, borderless market for pirated                 goods: "Instead
of reaching the limited                 number of people who can crowd around a
card                 table at a flea market, pirates can peddle their

and"macwarez," the                 vast PC world offering dozens of
new cracked                 software products every day while <strong>the Mac

individuals who are as much into the Cupertino                 mystique as they
are the technology. In fact, the                 latest word out in the Macwarez
scene is that                 pirates shouldn't copy Apple's OS8--Mac's latest  
              operating system--they should buy it, since Apple

<td>Warez the beef According to Sandra Sellers, a                 member of
SPA's antipiracy brigade, criminal                 prosecution under current
copyright law requires                 that the defendant have received
commercial or                 financial gains (See Cracking loopholes).         
       Although there have been recent attempts in                 Congress to
deal with net based piracy--for                 instance, Senator Patrick Leahy
recently                 introduced <strong>a bill to close this               
 not-for-profit loophole in the law</strong>--until                 government
acts, pirated software is going to                 flow freely, unfettered over
the Internet,                 available to anyone who wants it. For those       
         involved in warez, it's about things other than                 money:
speed; conquest; the high of defeating                 rival couriers.

<td>Although pirates admit their biggest fear is                 being rousted
out of bed by the FBI, they have                 little to worry about.
January's <strong>Cyber                 Strike, the FBI's most ambitious
Internet                 antipiracy act to date</strong>, when the Feds         
       raided businesses and homes in half a dozen                 states,
seizing computers, modems and illegally                 copied software,
<font size="4"><strong>resulted                 in no arrests.</strong></font>
Why no jail time?                 The pirates can thank ex-MIT student David    
            LaMacchia, who, in 1995, was charged with running                
two bulletin boards off his university's server                 that offered an
estimated $1 million worth of                 software for free download. Ruling
that no                 commercial motive existed, the judge, from the          
      U.S. District Court in Boston, threw the case                 out.
Prosecutors then tried charging LaMacchia                 with wire fraud, but
they lost on that, too, so                 he walked.</td></tr>

<td>But perhaps people like LaMacchia are doing                 the industry a
favor. Although software makers                 moan about how much the warez
scene is costing                 them, warez junkies claim they are actually

<td>said Klingon, a 10-year veteran of the warez                 scene. "Many
of us work at companies where                 we are the ones who decide what
software our                 company buys. So it's important that we sample     
           software, and believe me, if the software is                 good, we
buy it. Plus a whole generation of kids                 who can't afford to pay
for the latest software                 release get to learn about it anyway,
which                 increases computer literacy. There's no way they          
      can claim that every piece of pirated warez would                
translate into a sale for them. To them it means                 money, but to
us it's just hard drive space, a                 hobby, like stamp collecting or

<td>Type "warez" in a search engine and                 you'll see
it's one popular pastime,                 international in scope, with sites

     collected works of Microsoft (Windows NT, all the                 betas for
Windows 97 and even advance versions of                 Windows 98) to lists of
cracked software equipped                 with User IDs, registration and serial
numbers,                 to even lists of stolen credit cards, which can        
        be used to purchase more sophisticated hardware.                 If
SPA's Sellers had her way, net-based software                 pirates would walk
the plank. But she will not                 only have to wait for a change in
law; she will                 also need an increase in her budget, which is     
           about $3 million a year, 90 percent of it                 earmarked
for software audits. This is when                 companies are investigated for
making                 unauthorized copies, usually in the interests of         
       cutting costs. Ironically, American business,                 which has
helped fuel the legitimate software                 industry, is more vulnerable

off the site and got to work, expunging                 any serial numbers that
could be used to trace                 the software back to the company-- and,  
              ultimately, to Mutant. Any encryption or                
watermarks were likewise eradicated and the                 software was
compressed. The cracker even went so                 far as to supply a user ID,
registration number                 and the release group's imprimatur, its

possible, as quickly as possible. Sometimes                 "racing"
occurs, which means rival                 couriers are upping the same release
onto the                 same site at the same time. But this is generally      
          frowned upon, since it can screw up a release.                 Word
