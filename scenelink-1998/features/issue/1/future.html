<p align="right"><cite>One of the biggest problems with starting a new emag is
writing the code, which explains why coders rank at the top/near top of just
about every emag nfo. It's fine to release ascii, but a coded form provides a
lot of benefits like the ability: to include graphics, to prevent people from
modifying your articles, and to put everything in one file. To help encourage
new emags to start up, we'd like to write an easy to use code for editors to
produce a simple coded emag.

form would help us to spread the news even further. Lots of people in the scene
don't have web access, or have machines that don't work well the newer browsers,
and some people just dislike the web in general. The file would also be a good
way to publisize scenelink itself since it could be upladed to ftp sites, put on
dcc bots, or uploaded to boards. </cite></p></td>

<p align="right"><cite>The lit gallery is up, but we still need to find
releaible people to manage the galleries for vga, ansi, ascii, music, and demos.
The galleries will be a place for people to get a survey of what's new, targeted
at both scene regulars and those outside the scene. For scene regulars it'll be
a way to keep track of what kinds of work individuals or groups are doing
lately, and for those outside the scene it'll be a great chance to see the best
the scene has to offer. For example, warez people would be unlikely to download
the latest twilight pack, an ansi viewer, unzip all these, and shell to dos to
view it, but they'd probably click on a jpg version of the image. If you'd like
to help out, get more info on the gallery page. .

<p align="left"><cite>Still very much in the discussion stage, lots of
copyright issues to be disussed&#8230; The general idea would be to release cds
of scene material to the public to help expose people to past works. Some
possible ideas include: a years worth of music/art/demos/emags on a disc a
collection of interviews (audio), nfos, logos, articles, and packs for a kind of
group history results from music/art/demo compos we'd organize Obviously
everything would need to be cleared with the artists, but it would be a good way
to rasie a little money for the scene ftp server. NOTE: once again, no one in
scenelink makes ANY money off the group

<p align="left"><cite>RThere are too many articles on software piracy that
never mention the warez scene, and too few that get written on any other scenes.
Most of this can be traced back to writers without the time to spend delving
into the scenes, or without a clue as to their existence. Scenelink, as a
totally legitamite organiztion, could be the go between to help reporters write
articles that gave credit to the little world we've created. For the art scene,
we can mail out info packets to newspapers and magazines describing a little
about the scenes with an offer to help reporters put together stories. Given the
usual white space newspapers have to struggle with, hopefully we can get a few
publications to do small features on the scene instead of another Kathy Lee
Gifford story.

require convincing lots of groups to leave the "safety" of efnet,
which is why we're not even thinking about this for another 6 months. There
would be a lot of advantages to creating a scene only irc server, right now some
of them that come to mind: eliminate all the takeover bullshit that takes up so
much of our time more flexibility in adding new servers, any group that wanted
their own server could have it cut down on the lag considerably privacy, to some
extent a bot friendly policy, and even assistance getting bots up eliminate the
complete lamers that join #ansi, #warez950 or whatever. Similar channels would
exist on the new server, but people would have to know enough about the scnes to
have that irc address

probably start with some small histories of groups and then look at a more
comprehensive one later on. The history would include interviews with dozens of
people, like the founders, some of the groups competitors, and of course an
interview with the current membership. A larger article with timeline would be
put together from the interviews, articles in emags, nfos, and any other sources

supply of dead groups, but we'd also like to include groups that died a long
time ago.  Anyone who spent time in a group that meant something to you, contact
us so we can start making the tombstone. Hopefully each entry would have a
couple of the logos, nfos, and interviews with former members&#8230; who knows,
perhaps current groups will be able to learn from old mistakes.
