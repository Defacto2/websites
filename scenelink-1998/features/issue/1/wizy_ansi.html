<p><b>Very late last night i began organizing a takeover of #ansi, fed up with
the state it was falling into,  nothing against its current controlers. I wanted
it to be more about the art scene, like it used to, after awhile i had to sleep,
being a human being and all. This morning i woke up to find they already had it
back, i fully expected that. I took it again, and we began to talk, i got alot
of the art groups out there to agree with me, and heads of some of the bigger
ones joined me, after awhile cash showed up (he runs the 5 #ansi bots right
now), he wasnt to happy with me, we have been friends for a good 3 years. We got
to talking, and worked it out, so that I can get the stuff done that i want, and
we keep his bots, he has 5 stable bots and the want to run them, i am all for
that, i will be putting one up as well. After we got all that sorted out, and
agreed to help each other, its all good. Now on with the new idea's for the new
#ansi.
</b></p>
<p><em>First off, #ansi used to br an integral part of the ansi/art scene
users would join #ansi and ask for a peice of art and get it no problem now you
join, and get no answer, or the 1 that does reply asks for money. This is a sad
state. Next problem was that no one really talked about the scene, and no real
scene related things happened in there. I feel that #ansi should have monthly
events, and help keep the scene together, i dont want to be one of the hundreds
of others saying the scene is dying, but its not getting any better. I feel that
#ansi could play a big part in bringing some life back into it. So, after some
more talking with cash and others, they liked my idea's and i liked theres. We
now have some of the basics worked out.
</em></p>
<p><em>We want a newsletter, and aCk has agreed to organize one. It will
probably be monthly, that is what we would prefere anyways.  If you would like
to help, or contribute to it in any way you should contact him, since i lost his
email address, just send the email to the addess listed below and i will make
sure he gets it.
</em></p>
<p><em>We will be attempting to setup a request bot, probably just adding a
tcl to an existing bot. It will be used for users to request art from artists.
The basic idea is this: an artist is free, he/she adds  him/herself to the bot,
and when a user wants something, they request a list from the bot, the bot msg's
or notice's it to them, and they leave a request on that bot for osme art from
the artists of their choice. I belive this will be one of the hardest things to
get going, for the simple fact that we have to get a decent number of artists
behind it, and get them to offer their services.</em></p>
<p><em>Next thing is a file server, for the scene, we will be getting philez 
back, on a new site, and we will be assigning anyone who is willing  and has the
time (we have a couple candidates, but are looking for  anyone willing) to keep
it up, daily. Just email us if you might be  interested in contributing to it.</em></p>
<p><em>I would like to see some form of "End of the Month" time, for
pack reviews, and other things like that. One idea for it, is to get some of the
people who already do that work to help out, such as MixelPlik (whitetrash) of
Touretts. They would host the "End of the Month" time in #ansi,
probably on a 30th or 29th, not possitive. The channel would be set +m, and they
would be able to show their reviews, then it would be -m'd and a disscusion
about the reviews, and why they are right or wrong would ensue. I would love any
suggestions as to how we might do this or even volunteers to help out with it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Well ive babbled on enough, thats about all i have to say, of
course i dont run the scene, this doesnt have to happen, but i would like to see
most of it get done. I think the scene can use this form of interaction, and
participation. It will open up alot more communication than we have right now.
Thanks for reading this far :)
