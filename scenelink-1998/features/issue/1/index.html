outlines were made in March... and                 the group was formed in May.
Now, after hundreds                 of hours scenelink begins. Now that we've   
             finished the issue (except for material we're                 still
waiting on groups to send) we'll finally                 have time to reflect on
what a strange                 experience this has been so far. </font><font size="3"><br>                 </font></td></tr></tbody></table>

            newbies, and an immature attitude, #ansi has been                
peacefully taken over by a group who want things                 to change. At
one point an integral part of the                 ansi/art scene, the new group
hope to make it so                 once again. </font><font size="3"><em>by

<p><font face="Arial">This web site may look impressive         (come on,
humor us...) but there's a lot more to         scenelink then just a
comprehensive scene news resource.         From the beginning scenelink was
designed to be modular,         to serve as a foundation for future projects.
Coming         soon, a list of <u>what the site has to offer now,</u>        
and some of the projects we've considered taking on in         the future.
