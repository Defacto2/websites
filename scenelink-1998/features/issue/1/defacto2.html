may remember Defacto 2 as a scene magazine in late 1996, early 1997. 
Unfortunately the days of Defacto 2 as a scene magazine are over but  Defacto 2
is far from dead. The same reliable coverage you came to expect  for new events
will now be directed on past ones. I have always felt that our  scene lacked a
sense of history. It's not that the history doesn't exist,  it's just that
trying to find the information is a difficult and often  fruitless task.</p>
<p><em>That's why I have always envisioned a web page dedicated to the PC 
scene of past. In two plus years of searching the web I have yet to fina a page
dedicated to the PC pirate scene and it's history.  Just visit Fairlight's
European page for example. They have a section  dedicated to C64, Amiga and the
PC but the PC section remains empty.</em></p>
<p>At the time of writing this <a href="http://www.defacto2.org/">www.defacto2.org</a>
is the only page/museum  in the world strictly for the PC scene and to keep it
alive I need  people to send me everything they have which they believe could be
 useful for this page. If you have any old group NFOs, cracktros,  intros, BBS
adverts, famous BBS ANSI welcome screens, old scene  magazines (No that does not
mean RCN #1), etc. please email me at  webmaster@defacto2.org.</p>
