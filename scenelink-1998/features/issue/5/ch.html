<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Looking back on the history of the scene... what's one thing in particular that sticks with you from the old scene?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Well looping 2 <a href="http://www.att.com/">at&amp;t</a>
conference calls together 15 nodes and calling 1-900 numbers...
actually the teamwork and friendships I had in order to make the whole
thing work...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Just to put this in perspective... who would you say the "major contenders" were at the time?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> It was always INC and THG that counted. <a href="http://www.razor1911.com/">Razor 1911</a>
struggled for a bit... at one time it was only INC when THG folded,
then Razor came on strong feb 1992. INC and THG did some nasty things
to each other but INC always seemed to come out on top, mainly because
THG's leader the candyman was an asshole and treated people like <a href="http://www.shit.com/">shit</a>.  It was cool to hang with INC, we had fun with a capital F.
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> What was your favorite release you had a hand in?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> I had my hand in
over 3000 releases but the best ones were the ones we stole from THG
like Red Baron. Here's how hard it was to compete... The humble babe
[originally of THG] then [later USA] drove an ambulance for a living
and would turn the sirens on to get to UPS when it opened to get her
wares!
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Can you describe the typical release process in "the old days" from pickup to upload?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> THG claimed to revolutionize the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>
scene and I will give it to them they did... before them everything
came from the stores and they began to buy with cash then we red
labeled... so money got involved and it took a treasury of abut 3000 a
month to stay on top... in the beginning we had people who worked at <a href="http://www.ebworld.com/">EB</a>, <a href="http://www.egghead.com/">Egghead</a>, and walk-ins from local areas... also beta testers at SSI and the company that makes Might &amp; Magic... also <a href="http://www.sega.com/">Sega</a> and <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/">Nintendo</a>... Then they [THG] would get a beta tester busted... we would make a phony newspaper collage and convince places like <a href="http://www.ea.com/">EA</a>
that we write a games section for the paper and wanted to try out new
releases they would send them to us... we had a guy who reviewed games
for Gaming Monthly...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Where did the funding come to keep the releases <a href="http://www.flow.com/">flow</a>ing?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Money came from
members and from sysops, the scene was so cool that people would give
money and hardware just to have a mention in one of our nfos. THG and <a href="http://www.razor1911.com/">Razor</a>
sold t-shirts [which was lame]... What ever they could contribute, if
they did not have anything that was fine... everybody did what they
could to stay #1.
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Geographically, was there any one central area that you could pin down as "the heart of the scene" at the time?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> In the beginning
San Jose, then Dallas and New York but THG was Tenn. USA was Seattle I
think... but Dallas has had a lot of people involved...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> How aware was the general populace of this underground scene? Did the cops have a clue?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> They only knew what people told them, they basically were not interested. Carding and phreaking kept them busy...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Would you say some basic phreaking skills were a requirement at the time due to the limitations of area codes/LD?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Well the rule was "don't wear out a code and don't do it if you're over 18."
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Was there any action going on in Europe at this time or was it mainly centered in North America?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Well Europe was pretty lame for a long time... But game marketing changed and games started being released first overseas. <a href="http://www.bullfrog.ea.com/">Bullfrog</a> in England was a good source... The first big Eurorelease I remember was Ultima 7.
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Can you remember the PC you "entered the scene with?" =)
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Oh yea, a hyundai
8088 XT - ran my first bbs which was awesome on a 30 meg hd. First
giant release I remember was a 7 720 meg game called "Codename
Iceman"...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> I remember that release.
<br><img height="172" width="275" align="right" src="ch.html_files/sth.jpg">
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> An INC release
supplied by someone from Dallas. I had a 2400 at first, then I was the
second person next to Freddy Krueger Elm Street to get a usr 9600 Bps
modem. I was something special with that modem... 2nd in my area code.
My highest phone bill for the month was $2700 dollars in ld calls.
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> OUCH! =)
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> How long you been in the scene?
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Been in the scene...hmmm... I have 5 1/4 inch disks still with old warez on them...
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> What was you first cracked game released by a group that you remember?
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> My favorite old warez games... Populous, Double
Dragon...I remember that Codename Iceman game specifically, but I
dunno, I have a bad memory...
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Populous was an
INC game and Double Dragon was a game that PTL released a long time
ago. A certain few ruled the whole damn world with warez, Russia,
Germany, Italy, and Portugal, all these people <a href="http://www.kissass.com/">kissing your ass</a> in different languages, it was awesome... just rambling...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> So was it always a bit about the power trip?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Why of course, it's alot of that and the camaraderie...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> What do you attribute your success in the scene to? Dashing good looks, etc? *grin*
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Hard work... sacrifice... dedication... and <a href="http://www.mvhs.srvusd.k12.ca.us/%7Edshanthi/insomnia/insomnia.html">no sleep</a>...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> I assume you are in some sort of career now...
have you been able to make use of any warez related skills in your
post-scene life?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> It's gotten me several jobs... I once told a boss that I had <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">DOS 5.0</font></a>.
He said, "No you don't" and I said, "If I do, then I get the job". He
agreed and I brought it to him the next day... and got the job, you
know we get things early.
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> What names would you pick out as "innovators," or people who made a significant impact on the scene?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> candyman, line noise, slavelord (used to be known as timelord), hardcore, genisis, humble babe, thecracksmith 
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> What did they contribute?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Well they all dedicated a good part of their lives and money to make things work...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Ok, gotta ask this one... did being the leader of INC ever get you any <a href="http://www.nookie.com/">nookie</a>? =)
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Nah, I am
married, but there was one of the first girls on the scene from AZ that
was giving it out to all INC members. And once magnum and I fought over
a topless dancer one night at a party with the bar manager...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Ok, <a href="http://www.joe.com/">Joe</a> <a href="http://www.lamer.com/">Lamer</a> from #freewarez asks you "How can I be successful in the scene?" How do you reply?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> CONTRIBUTE
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> In your experience, what % of any given release crew carries the group...?
<br><img height="200" width="320" align="right" src="ch.html_files/inc1.gif">
<br><b><fontcolor ="#0000A0">[ cool_hand ]</fontcolor></b> 10%  is average for a group, INC was probably more like 25% because people just wanted to see it stay on top...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> What's the craziest stunt you ever pulled online...?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> The <a href="http://www.911.com/">911</a> <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">virus</a>
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> What's the story behind that?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Some hacker in the group, night ranger or somebody, wrote this <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">virus</a> that dials <a href="http://www.911.com/">911</a>
when it finds a modem. We put it in a ware that was given to THG which
they released. I know several of them got visits from the cops and they
had no idea what was going on...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> What was the thing you disliked most about the scene?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Money got
involved and people who ragged or complained about warez we bought with
our money and busted our asses to get out phone bills to spread... free
to them and they complained that the game <a href="http://www.suck.com/">suck</a>ed, like we wrote it or the <a href="http://www.coke.com/">crack</a> did not work, that's my biggest peeve.
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Btw, how the <a href="http://www.hell.com/">hell</a> did you manage to pay $2000 phone bills!??
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Took three months without a phone...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> What do you think of current efforts to unite
various sectors of the scene under one cooperative umbrella? art, demo,
music, warez....
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Been tried been done doesn't work too many egos and too many people wanting to be in charge... kinda like the <a href="http://www.mtv.com/mtv/tubescan/rw6/">real world</a>... It becomes an empire and we know what happens to empires, they fall.
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> What do you think of scenelink?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> I think magazines
are an important part of the scene, they're a way to get messages out,
get rid of rumors, and provide a way for old timers like myself to have
one last moment of glory...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Well, you have a lot of good stories to tell, and
us youngsters can always learn a thing or two from someone who's been
there before.
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Yea more good times than bad...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Last <a href="http://www.q.com/">Q</a>, is there such a thing as life after warez? *grin*
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Sure, I have an
ftp site that I've had for a long time... it's pretty awesome to
boot... would also like to get involved in a group again too. I have
lots to offer... but it would have to be a group that is serious...
<br>
<br><b>[ DToxR ]</b> Do you see yourself becoming active again anytime in the future?
<br>
<br><b><font color="#0000a0">[ cool_hand ]</font></b> Maybe. You never know. I haven't really been asked...
