        straight... ;) Our BBS, run by Pharaoh, Devious Doze,
        myself (RoAMER) and a few others was not taken down by
        the feds, nor narced by Chinablue (a good and dear
        friend) or anything else i've been reading around. It was
        a CAAST Bust (ie. all Canadian) with a lamer (The Great
        One) sent in to buy some CD's... Pharaoh didn't do that
        generally since he was a very busy person in real life,
        and did it as a favor to a _supposed_ old acquaintance.
        Alas, they arrived and took all his equipment. There are
        no criminal charges. And it's still not resolved. Nuff
        Said. RoAMER (of BONG / SiEGE now...) </td>
