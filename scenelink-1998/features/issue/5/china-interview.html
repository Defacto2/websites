        long have you been involved in the scene?</strong></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="3"><br>
        About two years plus some months </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong><br>
        <br>

        What positions have you held during that time? </strong></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="3">Prior to I-Net I was president of
        UPSS &lt;g&gt;, since i came i-net, i've been everything
        from a member to a 'leader' to a 'founder' in my
        groups...i've been a trader...for Everlast,
        Empire,Paradigm, and Razor...that's LD trader,
        analog..not net =) and i was very good, usually making
        the top ten each week on the boards i traded
        to...Malevolence, Purgatory and Street Spyder's ...was a
        'co-founder' of Apoc with Bandito, was a 'co-founder' of
        Executive with WKnight...was a leader in Siege, was a
        leader in MTY, was a PDM member in good standing, a
        member in good standing with Class, and a member in good
        standing when PDM merged with Razor. I've been a supplier
        for the past year or so..that's software and hardware-
        .for PDM,MTY,Razor,Empire, Class,Executive and Siege and
        i've supported more than just my groups...i have
        supported different sites , boards, groups and
        individuals ...if there was a need, and we could fill
        it..we usually tried to do that.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong><br>

        <br>
        Please describe the events that led up to your retirement
        </strong></font><font size="3"><br>
        <br>
        That's a funny story...I just got tired of saying no when
        lamers would ask me if i narked Akira or if I had narked
        this xforce member or that xforce member...and i got
        tired of the packages coming to my real address, and the
        phone calls to three of my phone lines..and the bullshit
        email and logs of my personal info and stuff like that
        -and hearing from different people in the scene that
        xforce said this, or xforce said that &lt;referring to me
        being a nark or a fed&gt; and refusing logs of stingray
        and his 'boys' pasting my personal info in channels, or
        saying i was a fed cuz they were 99% sure &lt;g&gt;....it
        was getting to be no fun, and like harassment..so i just
        talked with my d00dz and decided to pull the plug before
        they followed through on threats they had made to several
        different people ...and yes, it's all confirmable...and
        no im not gonna get into who it can be confirmed
        with...it's over..im outta the scene, so it won't do any
        good <br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong><br>
        <br>
        Who in particular do you believe was responsible for the
        personal attacks on you?</strong></font><font size="3"> <br>
        <br>
        X-Force...definitely..that's what all the logs said,
        that's what all the guys said ...in particular, it was
        from Stingray... </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Do you have any insight as to the motivation behind the
        attacks?</strong></font><font size="3"> <br>
        <br>
        Well, i agree with what one of the founders of Siege
        said...it's just some strange mentality..whether it's
        jealousy or some over inflated ego or just this new 'bust
        or be busted' mentality that seems to have taken over the
        scene lately....all the nuking and narking and reporting
        peoples isps and taking over channels and hacking
        sites..it's insane, and so very counterproductive...and
        you can't even get a straight answer from the people or
        the groups that seem to originate all this
        negativity...so who knows? The only thing i know is that
        it sucks ...and I won't be a part of it ...the scene's
        not worth personal risk, or legal troubles ...not like
        this anyway </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>What
        was Bug Lords involvement in all of this? </strong></font><font size="3"><br>
        <br>
        Haha, i think Bug Lord started this somehow....we were on
        a conference call, i can't even remember when or who all
        was on it..i know bug was on it and some of the razor
        guys, maybe some xforce guys..i don't really
        remember..but siege had just had some of it's members
        k/bed from #ucf and #xforce and some other channels...so
        i was in this little 'msg war' with riddler and some guys
        ..i think random and somebody else, but i don't remember
        who it was ..about six months ago..anyway, these other
        guys start pasting me logs of different channels and my
        personal info was showing up and some of the xforce guys
        were saying they were gonna 'kill' my isps or whatever it
        was ...so i was laffing and telling buggie on the
        conf..so he decided to take out riddler's router
        &lt;g&gt; and i laffed when he said that..well by the
        next day, it was all turned around..and i had 'begged'
        buglord to take out a router, instead of just laffing
        when he said he was going to...so a week later i ended up
        with no isps...and no shells...when i tried to talk to
        stingray about it , the whole conversation was bizarre
        and i just left it alone...i got new isps and got back
        online, and started supplying again.. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>What is your
        opinion on the use of nukes/denial of service attacks
        within the scene? <br>
        </strong></font><font size="3"><br>
        it's lame and it should really stop...its about as lame
        as taking a channel or hacking a site..not to mention
        counterproductive as hell </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Do you think there was any connection between the denial
        of service attack and the anonymous phone call to your
        ISPs?</strong></font><font size="3"> <br>
        <br>
        At this point in time, i think that's a moot
        point...probably, maybe...i dunno </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>What were the
        official reasons given for the cancellation of your
        Internet services?</strong></font><font size="3"><br>
        <br>
        f***** canceled because some new guy was on when the
        email and phone calls came in..the 'owner' is a personal
        friend of the family, so when he got back from his little
        vacation i went over and talked to him and i got one of
        the accts back, but no shell =( netcom sent all my stuff
        over to 'netcom abuse' department...and since it was the
        third or fourth time they grabbed it, i couldn't get them
        back...&lt;shells and two isp connex&gt; earthlinnk just
        canceled the accounts and shell and website...for
        violation of terms of service <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Narcing is a
        very serious offense in this business, as far as you
        know, do "they" have any solid proof to support
        this accusation? </strong></font><font size="3"><br>
        <br>
        nope...im not a nark, never was...i'm a supplier...or was
        one, of software AND hardware...and have enough friends
        in the scene that i have supported in different ways that
        know im not a fed or a nark or whatever they're saying,
        or said...stingray's 'proof' was something about a phone
        call from florida ...that's it =) which is kinda sad,
        because we know now that there was a whole lot more to
        this story than a phone call from florida... <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Were there any
        other circumstances that played a part in your decision
        to call it quits? </strong></font><font size="3"><br>
        <br>
        yeh, it's not fun anymore...too many really really lame
        people in the scene now, with serious conflicts..maybe no
        lives, i dunno...it used to be fun, it was US against
        THEM..with them being the publishers and big business,
        and us being anybody who could get a new title and rip it
        or trade it or crack it, or anybody who could set up a
        site or a bbs ...and it was US putting it out...so
        everybody could use it or play it , without paying big
        bux for the privilege...now it's all takeover of
        channels, hacking of sites, nuking and bonking and
        boinking...calling isps, stealing releases off rival
        sites...it's not fun...that's the major reason...i'm not
        saying i'm done forever, cuz i really liked this pirating
        stuff ...but i'm a little bit leery of just doing it so
        open like before...because there are some seriously bent
        people in the scene now..if they can't out release
        somebody, or out trade or out crack...they're gonna nark
        that person just to eliminate the competition...and
        that's seriously fukked ...i wish it was like before, but
        somehow i don't have a lot of faith that things are going
        to get fixed...and that's sad...it should be FUN, and
        challenging, and it's not...now its all ego and phone
        calls to isp's and nuking and channel takeovers... one
        thing i would like to say is that all of you in the scene
        who remember the way it used to be need to lay siege and
        take it back ..make it right again ...that would be
        sincerely KEWL ... </font></p>
