that would make Bill Clinton weak in the         knees, ChinaBlue announced her
retirement from the         scene.&nbsp; It appears at this time that XForce may
have         been the source of the accusations and harassment, but,         so
far, XForce has declined to comment on their         involvement. No matter
who's to blame, it's obvious that         something went wrong. </font><a href="china-main.html"><font size="2"><em>more</em></font></a></td></tr>

scene (see the </font><a href="../features/issue/4/iso.html"><font face="arial" size="1">article</font></a><font face="arial" size="1"> that ran
last issue) has taken a major step         towards ensuring its future
development. Leading groups         like RiscISO have finally agreed on a set of
standards         for releasing and couriering. Restrictions include NO        
BETAS, NO PSX, and OLDER THAN ONE MONTH. This text file         explains it all.

<td bgcolor="#cdc7cd" width="155" valign="top"><font size="3"><strong>New
pack review coming</strong></font><font size="2"><br>         Okay I'll cut
the crap. FNu is a pack review page. Where         did I get the idea? What does
the name mean? The idea         came up when I was talking to dngrmouse on irc.
I was         talking to bedlam at the same time about ANKH, he said it        
wasn't worth it. I told him I could do it and have fun.         So bed- here it
is. About the name. Well dngrmouse wanted         to call it "uNF" and
i figured if people heard         of a pack review page named "uNF"
they'd say         "typical" and just keep ircing without even        
looking at the page. So, out came FNu (for you retards,         uNF backwards).
Plus I always hear "what does FNu         stand for, anyway?" on irc.
FNU DOES NOT STAND FOR         ANYTHING. Either way, welcome to 1998. Look for
an         announcement about FNu in a few weeks on scenelink.<br>

at least that's what William Tingle says. Who's         William Tingle? I have
no idea, but he's selling tshirts         with the word "warez"
written on the front, so         perhaps I'll be contacting him soon. Then
again, maybe         I'm not quite that big a warez geek yet. If you are,
