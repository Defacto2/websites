those unfamiliar with them, Dupe checkers are scripts or programs that allow
users to search releases (warez) by date, name, or other values. Aside from
satisfying simple curiosity, Dupe checkers give couriers a way to make sure they
don't upload a release that's already on a site, and they give release groups a
way to make sure they don't duplicate previous releases of another group.

on BBSes as a way for sysops to nuke uploads. When files get moved offline, the
DIZ files are kept as a record of the releases' existence. 
</b><br><br><font size="+1"><b>Midsorrow (40 gig BBS sysop)</b></font><br>
I've always pretty much just relied on my memory to let me know which new
uploads are dupes of something already online, but even then, dupes do sometimes
slip through the cracks (and on a 40 gig system like the one I run, it's getting
QUITE difficult to dupe-check solely by memory).&nbsp; 
<br><br>Life on the BBS was a bit slower, so it was possible for a sysop to
keep it all straight. As people moved to the ftp sites, things sped up
considerably. Fast connections spread files quicker, and the growth of the
software industry meant there were more releases to spread. With around 60
releases a day now, it's almost impossible for sysops, couriers, and release
groups to keep it all straight in their heads.

As of this writing, there are three ways to check for dupes. The first, and the
simplest to use, is the irc dupe check. Several varieties exist, with the most
popular dupe checks being run out of #releases and #thescene. #releases's bot "Dupe"
responds to queries in the form of "!dupe" followed by a search
string, either in the channel or in a private message to the bot. Dupe will
respond with a message containing titles that match your query and the dates
that they were released. Limitations of IRC prevent dupe bots from returning all
hits to the searcher, though ops in #releases are excluded from this limitation.<br><br><b>Release
records for these dupe bots come from prominent ftp sites</b>. When a courier
uploads a release to one of those ftp sites, the system automatically adds the
information about the upload to the database and makes it available to the irc
bot. Search strings can be part of the name, the group that released it, or even
the date that the program was released on.
<br><br><b>...</b><br><br>About a month ago katman, a siteop on QC,
released a beta for a new kind of dupe check. Katman's dupe check, named "WinDupe,"
is a native win95 program that connects the user to an SQL database. Although
the user is required to run a separate program, WinDupe offers greater speed and
flexibility over irc dupe checkers because of its direct link to an SQL
database. WinDupe is faster then irc dupe checks, returns all hits for queries,
and allows users to manipulate those returns a little easier. WinDupe is
presently in its 6th beta, which can be <a href="wdupep65.zip">downloaded here</a>.
<br><br><b>...</b><br><br>The last alternative for dupe checkers is the
web.<a href="http://drinkordie.com/"> DOD</a> gets credit for creating the
first web dupe check, which seems roughly comparable in quality to WinDupe.
<a href="http://www.nrg2000.com/">www.nrg2000.com</a> offers an alternative to
DOD's, though the page is a bit more disorganized.<br><br>Scenelink itself
will enter the somewhat crowded field of dupe checkers in the near future. Our "Dupelink"
will be web based, and similar to the existing web dupe checks. The major
differences will be that entries in Dupelink will include links to nfos, a total
size, and a listing of every file included in the release.
