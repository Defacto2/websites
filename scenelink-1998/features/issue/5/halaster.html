        <td width="400"><font size="3">Today, many of the scene's
        citizens lament over the perceived decline of the
        computer art world.&nbsp; There have been several
        theories, explanations, articles and manifestos published
        over the past few months in response to this issue.&nbsp;
        One thing is certain many of the members of the art
        community are dissatisfied with its present productivity
        and character.&nbsp; The ever-present, old-school mantra
        "it was better in the old days" has never been
        so commonly used, and has never been taken so
        seriously.&nbsp; Once well-established art groups
        struggle to release monthly packs or die off
        completely.&nbsp; Artists, particularly ANSI artists,
        toss down their 'pens' in frustration daily, further
        thinning the pool of talent that group leaders need to
        draw from to keep their organizations viable.&nbsp; This
        trend must be reversed, and the entire scene will need to
        contribute its part in order to reverse it.&nbsp; While
        it is impossible to return to years past, while we cannot
        reverse the clock and travel back to the days when
        artists like Lord Jazz and Iodine produced astounding
        works in the ansi medium concurrently with contemporary
        hi-resolution visionaries like CatBones and RedMaN,
        certain aspects and traditions of the 'golden-age' scene
        can and must be resurrected to improve our current time.</font><p><font size="3">As artists like Bedlam and Maestro have
        asserted, the most important and obviously necessary
        ingredients for a thriving art scene are consistent,
        talented and productive artists.&nbsp; While the
        hi-resolution art arena has grown exponentially in the
        past few months, the ANSI art medium has suffered a
        corresponding decline.&nbsp; As an ANSI artist, I will
        address this specific component of the larger art scene
        'crisis' in this article. Returning once more to Bedlam's
        writings, one finds an emphasis on the importance of
        REQUESTS in the art scene relationship to the
        artist.&nbsp; Quite simply, artists like to feel like
        their work serves some purpose - be it monetary,
        decorative or thematic.&nbsp; Few artists like to draw
        solely for their own eyes, regardless of the motivations
        behind their creations even an artist who refuses to
        accept payment for his or her work still needs an
        audience.&nbsp; At the most fundamental level, a patron,
        or a person who requests work, serves as this
        audience.&nbsp; Speaking from personal experience, it is
        a wonderful feeling to know that a sysop or site
        maintainer appreciates the work that you have done.&nbsp;
        The lack of this sort of positive reinforcement can be
        seen as the possible cause for the eventual floundering
        of many of the scene's "art for art's sake"
        projects (such as those begun by artists like Nootropic
        and Eerie.)&nbsp; But I begin to digress .. to focus once
        more, REQUESTS are crucial to the continued existence of
        the art scene.&nbsp; One source of these requests,
        especially for ANSI artists, is the all-but-extinct
        Electronic Bulletin Board, or BBS. The Electronic
        Bulletin Board, the primordial birthing place of the
        underground computer art scene .. The BBS, the training
        grounds for hoards of the scene's most legendary ANSI
        artists .. The BBS world used to serve as the body of the
        art scene, just as the internet does today.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">However, differences in the
        technological (biological) makeup of these two body types
        have led, in part, to the unsatisfactory state that we
        now find ourselves in.&nbsp; BBS systems embodied much of
        what used to define and characterize the art scene.&nbsp;
        The BBS was exclusive, secretive and intimate.&nbsp;
        While many people view elitism as a negative thing (and
        rightly so), the benefits for the artist of a more
        intimate, personal mode of communication cannot be
        ignored.&nbsp; In days of yore, artists would exhibit
        unfinished ANSI works on message bases looking for advice
        or feedback, also serving to inspire other would-be and
        established creators.&nbsp; Artists like Logan of TRiBE
        even created apprenticeship programs to train new ANSI
        artists.&nbsp; I myself was taught many of the basics of
        ANSI art by Donut Hole, sysop of The Flying Donuts.&nbsp;
        Furthermore, BBSes were molded and controlled by their
        sysops, shaped into interactive experiences that
        reflected much of the sysop's aesthetics, values and
        visions.&nbsp; The Regency reflects much of my character
        through it's somewhat subdued and precise setup.&nbsp;
        Callers to The Heretic Asylum could not help but be
        impressed by the board's Jello-green setup, created by a
        myriad of artists but unified by the sysop's over-riding
        vision.&nbsp;&nbsp; The comparably homogeneous mediums
        that we use to communicate today (the World Wide Web,
        IRC, E-Mail) lack this individualistic character.&nbsp;
        While it can be argued that the medium of the WWW is more
        flexible than that of the BBS, it is an undeniable fact
        that 90% of the web pages currently published operate
        under the same design paradigm, presenting the user with
        a simple, categorized, point-and-click interface.&nbsp;
        While BBSes also operated under a standard, three-fold
        paradigm consisting of the Main, Message and Transfer
        areas, many systems also had door games, art galleries or
        real-time chat. Regardless of the features present, a
        well-crafted Electronic Bulletin Board, in my opinion,
        always had more character and was always more inspiring
        than a web page.&nbsp; BBS users were immersed in a
        sysop-controlled world of darkness, punctuated and
        choreographed by carefully designed graphics and bursts
        of information.&nbsp; The World Wide Web browser, as an
        interface, constantly reminds the user that he or she is
        _viewing_ something, as opposed to being immersed in it,
        through the ever-present scroll bars, 404-errors and
        Netscape logo.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Regardless of aesthetic, subjective
        considerations, one cannot argue the fact that the BBS
        has, inherently, a much greater need for ANSI art than
        does a web page.&nbsp; As an ANSI artist interested in
        the survival of the medium, I only see one escape from
        the form's current death-row crisis.&nbsp; The Electronic
        Bulletin Board must be revived. As of January 30th, 1998
        and for the foreseeable future, The Regency, one of the
        world's foremost art boards, will be back on-line.*&nbsp;
        For now, at least, the board will only be accessible
        through old-school dialup access.** My mission will be to
        capture or create, if necessary, a demand for this
        admittedly antiquated form of communication.&nbsp; Over
        the next few months, I will be organizing an old-style
        crashmail network, to be called (aptly enough)
        RegencyNET.&nbsp; The Regency's one famous local message
        bases will be accessible by sysops across the country for
        a few cents in long distance dialing charges.***&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">This is my manifesto&nbsp; A call to
        all former art sysops.&nbsp; BRING BACK YOUR
        BOARDS!&nbsp; Together, we can revitalize the old, local
        pockets of artistic talent that led to this scene, that
        maintain this scene and whose current absence is leading
        to the decline of the ANSI medium (and possibly to the
        art scene as a whole.)&nbsp; Modems need ANSI.&nbsp;
        Bulletin Boards need ANSI.&nbsp; The art scene needs
        ANSI.</font></p>

        off-line mail readers (OLR's) are also available!&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">*** RegencyNET has actually been
        scrapped in favor of a message network dedicated to
        supporting the BBS revival organization, Resurrection,
        that The 4th Disciple, Gunthar and myself have
        begun.&nbsp; Stay tuned for details about this group and
