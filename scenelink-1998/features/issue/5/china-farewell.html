        <td width="350" valign="top">Hi! After much thought and
        plenty of trying to get out of it..I'm going to have to
        call my own bluff...I always said 'I do this thing for
        FUN..and when it's not fun i'm going to pull the
        plug'...well, it's not fun anymore....and it probably
        won't be fun anymore , not when we have people in the
        scene like stingray and his little motley crew of lamers
        spreading all kinds of stupid rumors and vicious lies
        ....i tried to ignore them, like i was advised to do by
        my mentors &lt;who, btw, have more scene in them than ten
        stingrays&gt;...but their lies and all the silly little
        games just got more vicious and outlandish and it was
        cutting into my online things i do ..yes i really do
        stuff in the scene &lt;g&gt;...after weeks of lamers
        msging me asking if i was a nark or a fed, cuz stingray
        said i was or xforce said i was, or was siege really the
        reason this guy got busted or that board got busted....i
        just finally had enough..it's stupid, its making me
        upset..and its just not FUN! so i'm pulling the plug
        Those of you who know me, know i love the scene..and i
        had lots of fun while i was a part of it ...but now its
        time to bid you all adieu...and say thanks for the good
        times, and all that rah rah stuff..... <p>my email stays
        the same ...chinablue@mobsters.com &lt;mailto:
        ...chinablue@mobsters.com&gt; </p>

        maddest paki curries on the net...stay strong, get
        BETTER! ciaocito Lester,digger &lt;g&gt; ciao babies To
        all you guys i sent hardware: i did it for the scene...no
        strings, never a request back for any special
        favors...you know that, and i know that...i think the
        last count was somewhere around 50 mainboards, 100 hard
        drives, 60 or so pentium chips, 30 or so video cards, 20
        or so accelerator cards..plus hundreds of megs of memory
        chips... and a few modems here and there hehe..use it in
        good ways please ...may your sites NEVER get hacked or
        narked.... all my lil paki curry buddies..i luv j00! stay
        fresh! TSR: blow me &lt;just kidding!&gt; hehe i HAD to
        say that, sorry &lt;g&gt; here's a little sample of some
        of the reasons I quit the scene...hope none of you ever
        have to go through it </p>
        <p>&lt;Stingray&gt; some ppl we trusted had ours too, but
        seems that one of them talked &lt;***&gt; &lt;siege
        member&gt; &lt;***&gt; hmm odd that he would do that
        after years in the scene &lt;Stingray&gt; hemp knows ppl
        yes &lt;Stingray&gt; the one giving the infos to fed is
        china blue &lt;***&gt; why is she doing that ?
        &lt;***&gt; how'd you find out &lt;***&gt; in a way she
        admitted it in a chat and I got some1 checking some files
        saying it came from usa/fl &lt;Stingray&gt; she is there
        and she was dumb enough to be proud of it
        &lt;Stingray&gt; she is in siege aswell &lt;Stingray&gt;
        I am 99% sure it is her as well as many people coming
        into channels saying, among other things; that im a fed,
        a nark, i narked xforce , ???, that i narked some bbs
        called akira, ???, that siege or me and ***, depending on
        who they heard it from ..narked puschell in germany,
        ????.... i think if you add it all up...its a bunch of
        j0nx coming from one person, that person is a little lame
        guy in XFoRCE named Stingray..and it all started over a
        phone conference that i joined at the request of Bug Lord
        and some other guys...here's the whole story... we were
        on a fone conference, some of us..i dont even know who
        all was on it except bug and i think a guy named random
        ...but anyway, our siege guys had just been banned from
        #ucf and some other channels...i took umbrage, hehe..like
        i always do...and started some dumb msg war with riddler
        and random and some other xforce guys...so then buggie,
        loving me like he does ...took out riddler's
        router..hehe...and i laffed &gt;OOPSIE&lt; so next thing
        i know, i got all kindsa problems with one stingray...and
        a week later, i lost all my isps and shells...due to
        anonymous phone calls and emails...coincidence? perhaps
        &gt;g&lt; and all my personal info is being pasted on the
        net by stingray's boyz...n e way, got stuff straight and
        came back on ..now again my info is all over the net and
        they're trashing in a different way...now its cb is a
        nark..so like i said before, its saying bye to too many
        of you...and for the record...im not a federal agent, or
        a nark </p>
        <p>=) </p>
        <p>ciaocito! </p>
