        would like to wish you farewell and the best of luck with
        your future CB.&nbsp; We've already begun to feel the
        sting of your departure and know you've left a hole that
        can never be filled.&nbsp; You are the best friend our
        group has ever had and I imagine thats true for countless
        others.&nbsp; Thank you for making sure everyone was
        always content and for ironing out all the problems that
        arose when we first got together.&nbsp; You will be
        sorely missed by all and we love you.</font></p>

        It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, but
        I must say that working with you always made them good. I
        am glad we became great friends and hope that will
        continue to blossom even though you have retired. Thanks
        for all your help, and I wish ya the best of luck in the
        future! And remember, don't let your bros push you
        around! :) </p>

        is a old friend from back on Aol days...prolly 4 years
        ago....she was sweet then and a sweetheart now...she was
        the nicest and most helpful people I ever met on this
        crazy thing we call the Net...it's a shame she got burned
        like she did...never ever would she do what she was
        accused of...NEVER. Siege will miss her sorely...but with
        her spirit here with us, we shall prevail and continue on
        like she wants us to. I will miss her as will everyone </p>

        China, you are the kindest, most loyal, dedicated,
        understanding and lovely person I have ever met in all my
        years in the scene. You have understanding beyond your
        years and it is sure to prove a valuable asset to you in
        your real-life endeavors, or perhaps it may be your
        tragic flaw. Through the triumphs and the victories,
        trials and tribulations you stood true to the game, and
        most importantly true to your friends. Words really
        cannot express how much you'll be missed; but let us hope
        that your retirement will not be in vain and that there
        will be a lesson learned by all who were fortunate enough
        to have known you. If there is one thing that I will miss
        about you the most, it's your aura, that turned darkness
        into light - never stop smiling. Stay in touch and see
        you on the flipside. </p>
