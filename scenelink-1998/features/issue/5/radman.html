        finger on what inspired me to write this, but it's about
        time...</em></font><p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Every year I read at least one article somewhere about
        how The ANSI Scene Is Dying, or how it just isn't as fun
        as it was.&nbsp; Every year!&nbsp; Each time it's the
        same article, same pessimistic message.&nbsp; Following
        it up would be another regurgitated response about how
        they have it all wrong.&nbsp; Typically, both would
        severely lack any factual content for support, consisting
        of no more than a bunch of poorly thought out opinions,
        all heavily biased towards the group they were in and who
        they were friends with at the time.) Does this really
        surprise anyone?&nbsp; I guess it shouldn't.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ANSI scene
        has always operated in a sort of "knee-jerk"
        fashion.&nbsp; As if there were some sort of an automated
        mechanism which controlled it all. It's become almost too
        predictable.&nbsp; For instance, how many have been
        shammed by any of the following...</font></p>
        <ol start="1" type="A">
            <li><font size="3">Someone hasn't been heard from in
                the past five days, rumor goes out that he died
                or quit the scene.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3">Group X's release is over a week
                late.&nbsp; It's dead.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3">Everyone from Group X has left and
                joined Group Y.&nbsp; You should too.</font></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font size="3">Anyone ever help perpetuate such a
        hoax, without first checking it's validity? Maybe it's
        just easier to sit there and and believe it, rather than
        dig down for the truth.&nbsp; It's a shame that we can
        disregard everything these people may have contributed in
        the past to US, members of the scene, and base our
        decisions solely on what we've heard in the last 24
        hours.&nbsp; That's 0-day mentality.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">A lot of people wonder why I'm still
        here, or what I think about the current state of the
        scene.&nbsp; In the past, I could have been the one
        writing one of those retorts to the garbage
        negativity.&nbsp; But here we are in the now. 1998.&nbsp;
        Now I read those articles about the ANSI scene going
        downhill and I think to myself,</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">" The ANSI scene I once knew is
        already dead. " </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Speaking as a veteran going on ten
        years, many things in the scene have changed, both for
        better and for worse.&nbsp; I really wish that some of my
        most memorable and exciting experiences with the ANSI
        scene could be shared with you all, but I just can't do
        them justice in words.&nbsp; I know that a lot of my
        decisions with my group have been misunderstood, and I
        accept that.&nbsp; No one else can see through my eyes,
        and maybe you're focusing too much on the last 24
        hours.&nbsp; But to answer the question at hand, why am I
        still here if I believe the ANSI scene is dead?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Simple.&nbsp; It's the same reason --
        exactly -- that I joined 10 years ago. Not to get warez,
        be elite, make money, talk on the computers, or any of
        that bullshit.&nbsp; Given, everyone is here for their
        own reason, but that's not what attracted me.&nbsp; The
        biggest reason you should be here is for the art itself.
        Everything else is just a frill.&nbsp; I continue to
        support the scenes because I have a deep appreciation for
        damn good art, and believe there may be an artist inside
        of me.&nbsp; People continue to seek good art, in all
        mediums.&nbsp; If you restrict yourself to one single
        artform in this ever-changing digital world of ours, you
        could be holding yourself back.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">There's something about the digital
        underground...&nbsp; The purity of it all. In the demo
        scene, coders were always years ahead of the commercial
        programmers.&nbsp; The tracking scene ran circles around
        mainstream computer composers.&nbsp; The PD folks could
        not even touch the raw talent of the ANSI scene. All of
        us; art, demo, and tracking people shared something in
        common.&nbsp; The ability to take a technical limitation
        and embrace it's boundaries, producing something
        magnificent, even claimed "impossible" in the
        past.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&nbsp; That is where the magic lies.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you've
        already have came to the same conclusion as I have, then
        you already know and understand that factors that have
        led this scene to it's downfall.&nbsp; But with every
        death there is a birth.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure
        if what we're doing with ACiD could be considered a birth
        or a rebirth.&nbsp; The rules are very different
        now.&nbsp; It's art from our souls, not a comic
        store.&nbsp; It's free, not for sale.&nbsp; More
        expressive than ever, back to the purity that it began
        with.&nbsp; Original.&nbsp; We still share some
        similarities of the ACiD of the past...&nbsp; We're eager
        to get involved with other underground scenes, to work
        together and keep the wheels in motion.&nbsp; It's only
        been six months since we've made the switch and it's
        already proved worthwhile.&nbsp; Once again the
        impossible has been made possible.&nbsp; We've brought
        ourselves back to the basics.&nbsp; With a new medium and
        friends who are eager to learn and exchange ideas, while
        honing their skills to the perfection the underground has
        earned its reputation for.&nbsp; We've taken it to the
        next level, while going back to what is real.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The format may die, but the expressions
        and dreams will not.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">This is why I'm still here.</font></p>
