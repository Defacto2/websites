<td width="350"><font size="3">Why in the world would a         well respected
member of the warez scene decide to quit         cold turkey for no apparent
reason? That question was on         a lot of peoples' minds when ChinaBlue
announced her         retirement from the scene this past month. Citing various 
       forms of harassment as the main reason in a letter         intended to
shed some light on the subject, ChinaBlue         went on to describe a series
of anonymous phone calls and         postings - the end result being the
cancellation of her         ISP accounts and her personal information being
plastered         on the 'net for all to see. In a "line of work"     
   where anonymity is key, this type of attack can be         devastating. The
source of these attacks is unknown,         although when asked, ChinaBlue is "99%
sure"         that the culprit is Stingray, an active member of X-Force    
    who was unavailable for comment for this feature. Logs         were provided
from a conversation in which         "Stingray" accuses CB of being a
narc. As an         interesting twist to this story, scenelink was contacted    
    by RoAMER, a staff member of Beyond Akira, which         ChineBlue had been
accused of narcing. RoAMER went on to         personally clear her from any
involvement in the board's         demise. The damage has already been done
however, and it         has cost the scene a valuable member and good friend. As
        for who is to blame, that is open to speculation;         ChinaBlue
would be the first to discourage starting any         more fires under what is
basically a done deal. In         business that's all about trickle down,
suppliers like         ChinaBlue are the source and the rest of us reap the     
   rewards. </font>
