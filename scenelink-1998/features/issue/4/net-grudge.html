        government's actions concerning piracy will change over
        the next year? </strong></font></td>

    <tr>
        <td width="500"><font face="Arial" size="2">I think it
        will be business as usual for quite a while as
        information is gathered, and then there will be a big
        series of busts. There are far too many people that could
        be covered in this act, so I think it will be just the
        big operators that are arrested, such that everyone else
        becomes scared (as has been seen numerous times in the
        BBS scene). As for how far and for how long they're going
        to press it, it's hard to say. Everyone is essentially
        guilty. I think you'll find that a small number of people
        will end up being prosecuted, in well publicized token
        trials.<br>
        <br>
        One of the key things to remember is that the US has one
        of the lowest piracy rates of the world, so what they
        think they'll achieve I have no idea. I think the US is
        one of the last countries that needs an act of this kind.</font></td>

        lot of the current people in those categories may retire,
        but if there's one thing I've learned, it's that there
        always seem to be plenty of people to replace those that
        get busted.</font></td>

        download from the web and I expect the only difference
        may be a slightly reduced transfer rate for US pirates
        (with fewer sites located in the US and more in other
        countries!).</font></td>

    <tr>
        <td width="500"><font face="Arial" size="2">I think there
        will be a few major changes to the scene in a years time.
        Firstly I expect that US based groups will die, either
        from members retiring or being busted. European based
        groups will flourish, and I expect established groups
        such as Hybrid will be placed in a very dominant
        position.<br>
        <br>
        In terms of supplying, I think there will be an increase
        in time before games are released. I doubt there will be
        very many people who will be risking the current supply
        methods that are very effective in the US. European
        groups may have to wait a few extra days before games
        arrive there.<br>
        <br>
        I don't see cracking as being a problem, since the
        majority of crackers are based outside the US. So
        essentially everything will operate as normal, but with a
        greater emphasis on Europe. Supplies may be a bit slower,
        but the games will get cracked, and distributed.</font></td>

    <tr>
        <td width="500"><font face="Arial" size="2">I think one
        positive effect (in my eyes anyway) will be the return to
        anonymity. Currently it is a very social environment, and
        everyone really knows what everyone else is doing (and
        who is responsible for what is done). Anonymity may allow
        some affected people to stay in the scene, and will also
        greatly reduce the chance of people getting busted. I
        think it will add to the fun, as you'll never really know
        what the other group is up to (or capable of).<br>
