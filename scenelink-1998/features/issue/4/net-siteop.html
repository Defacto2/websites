        <td width="500"><font face="Arial" size="2">They will do
        two things: they will actively monitor backbone
        connectivity through the Universities via sampling and
        they will require large ISP's like BBN Planet and MCI net
        to become responsible for traffic that passes through
        their networks by signing contract supported by random
        testing. There will be a less pro-active approach
        privately because companies are more interested in
        increasing revenue than monitoring traffic. Universities
        are where warez will be more risky to traffic. Sniffers
        are the only tool I am aware of that can monitor and
        record such traffic. Companies like Network General
        specialize in developing tools to monitor networks and
        trap certain data - anything from flesh tones, to
        keywords, to file types and strip packets looking for
        source and destination ip addresses.</font></td>

        <td width="500"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will
        adapt, new technologies will be created. More RAR's
        rather than zips because Sniffers flag zip files...etc.
        etc. It will not stop. Spoofing will be a common tool to
        use as well, covering ones trail is a common hacking tool
        which will work its way through the warez scene - so GET
        ON IT! Likewise, encryption will become more of a common
        resource as the government and big brother attempt to
        become more invasive. A good analogy is the video tape
        and music taping industry. These activities of pirating
        movies and audio is illegal, but never stopped.
        Technology has adapted to make them possible and private.</font></td>

        will go on. Law enforcement realizes that they cannot
        control the situation, so they act through deterrence
        rather than enforcement. This has been historically true
        whenever new 'crimes' have been legislated. Prostitution,
        Drugs... etc. etc. Deterrence is everything to law
        enforcement.</font></td>

        Think more about what you are doing. Don't stop, just use
        your head, its what got you where you are and you must
        continue to evolve. Use the resources you have available
        including encryption between sites. Don't be lazy. Change
        your ip address as much as possible, twice a month if
        possible.</font></td>
