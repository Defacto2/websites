        <td width="500"><font face="Arial" size="2">We can safely
        assume it depends mostly upon how much government funding
        those organizations authorized to make arrests are given.
        Believe it or not going after individuals does cost
        money, which comes from tax payers like you and me.
        Knowing the United States government, much like that of
        any other country - for those parties to make any kind of
        serious nation wide move similar to cyberstrike, (whose
        effects some of us are still feeling now) would require
        SERIOUS urging by SPA/PAP type organizations who in their
        search for "justice for the catalysts of the
        software industry" really end up paving the way for
        the pirates of tomorrow. History has proven time and
        again that rebellion strives under tyrannical rule; you
        try toshut these guys down and they just organize,
        strategize and hit you in your pockets harder from deeper
        underground. As far as prosecution goes, we'll just have
        to wait and see. I'm sure the ignorance (and perhaps
        stupidity)of certain federal agencies will lead to
        small-time pirates/bootleggers going down on trumped up
        charges in an attempt to make an example of them.</font></td>

        ISPs will tighten up security, preventing web pages
        supporting piracy from even going up in the first place.
        I maintain my belief that F.A.'s really don't know much
        about how the active pirate/bootlegging operations
        function, so we'll see a lot of traders and average joe's
        getting picked up and sensationalized. Main targets will
        most likely remain those who profit personally by selling
        copies of software/music to the public (you know who you
        are; heed the warnings).</font></td>

        run, some will hide, some will become more defiant. This
        may sound a bit sadistic, but a large scale bust every
        couple of years is beneficial to the OVERALL scene and
        paves the way for the greater good. Often times, things
        get out of hand, and what should be underground becomes
        public and commercialized to some extent. Put the fear of
        God in some of these big-headed group-leaders with their
        commercialized groups and you see scene 'values' change
        and revitalize. Those who once sold commemorative cds and
        similar memorabilia via their shockwave enhanced publicly
        accessible webpages, are now scared for their lives so
        they inevitably close up shop.</font></td>

        networks. We may see groups become more secretive and/or
        sysops/siteops more security minded. But in all honesty
        and realistically, don't expect to see many noticeable
        changes. Europe and Canada/South America will go
        unaffected; so don't look for the gears of progress to
        stop just because of some law written on paper and the
        busts of a few insignificants.<br>

        all, besides being able to try out software we would
        otherwise never have the opportunity to even look at, we
        are also driven by the fact that we are in defiance of
        the law and are pushing the boundaries. We've got 10

        <td width="500"><font face="Arial" size="2">Do not
        DISREGARD it. The key is self-education. If you
        understand that which threatens you, it no longer becomes
        a threat; because via proper analyzation you are able to
        make rational decisions and decide for yoursslf exactly
        what risks you want to take and are able to take. So hit
        the web and search for online resources, read the
        paper/listen to the news - browse online publications
        like Scenelink and similar webzines which open forums of
        discussion on these topics. Be sure to understand that
        for the vast majority of you, when your interest in the
        scene is long gone, you will want to be able to continue
        with the fulfillment of your life; be it a carreer or a
        family or whatever. Don't curb that destiny by doing
        stupid shit in the pursuit "cyberpower". These
        kids run around in the scene like they ownsome shit or
        like they are respected and their lives now have meaning.
        Well that fame and power you may hold is fleeting, and
        when it's gone and the swelling in your head has ceased
        you may very well find yourself flat on your ass trying
        to get other facets of your life back in order. It's only
        a hobby, keep it fun and non-profit. Good luck to you all
        in the future.<br>
