        <td width="500"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">THE
        WORLD'S REAL TOP 50 SITEZ is one of the largest web warez
        rankings on the net, facilitating piracy across the
        world. They've probably "taknen" millions of
        dollars away from pioneering companies like ID, Lucas
        Arts, Origin, Netscape, and hundreds more. Does this
        worry them? No. Even just a little? No. But they are, it
        turns out, very ethical folks after all. You see,
        effecitve immediately, they're cracking down on sites
        that offer passwords to porn sites. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Because you see, it's
        just wrong to take money away from the hard working men
        and women of the porn industry. These website owners work
        hundreds of hours to bring you the finest product
        possible, often more as a challenge to produce a quality
        product than just as a job. Oh wait, those were the
        software engineers. No, the porn industry is the one
        flooding your mail box with spam, setting up on join bots
        to message you in every channel on efnet, and plastering
        misleading advertisements all over the web.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">So if you're
        setting up a website, put warez all over the place, the
        software companies don't matter. Come on, what do we need
        them for? But if you're going to put up adult site
        passwords, you have no business being one of the WORLD'S
        REAL TOP 50 SITEZ. After all, in the words of these
        highminded individuals,</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">"XXX
        Password trading hurts the adult entertainment industry -
        and for many of us it is adult sites who we earn money
        from with banner ads. Does this not make sense to you?
        Think about it!"</font></p>
