        its more of a scare tactic then anything. I'm sure to
        some extent though, it will work. As for their method of
        arresting people, that's hard to say, but I suppose
        they'll try to take advantage of the IRC and FTP sites. </font></td>

        government is going to be, and how strong they'll come
        down on them. I don't think others people will have much
        of a problem, although site owners might. </font></td>
