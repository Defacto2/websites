<p align="left"><font size="+1"><cite><font color="#ff0000">Expect a little
present this year from <font color="#078e00">The Reviewers Guild</font></font></cite></font>.<br><font color="#ffffff">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>As most of you probably know, TRG releases
reviews of pirated games so that the everyday pirate doesn't have to waste time
downloading dull games or improperly cracked releases. Now TRG has taken on a
new project as well. They're calling it <b>'Games of the Year'</b> and the
purpose should be pretty obvious.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>If you subscribe to
any gaming magazines, you already know what to expect, as most magazines seem
compelled to give out some sort of awards around this time of year. TRG is
dividing the selection process into categories, including: Sports, RPG, and
Action. A single game will be selected as the year's best form each category. 
</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>No one knows for sure
yet if prizes will be awarded to the release group responsible for the game, but
TRG will do everything it can to make sure that a game's merit, and not group
politics, determines the winner.
</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>TRG has picked an
interesting means of selection for the contest.<br><br><font><tt><b> A form
will be included with every TRG review beginning in late December or early
January for readers to fill out and send in over email.</b></tt></font><br><br>
This means it will be up to the readers to make the final decisions! Everyone
will be able to get the forms from reviews on any of TRG's three public ftp
sites or from their web page at <a href="http://trguild.ml.org/">http://trguild.ml.org</a>.
If you can't find the time to download a TRG review, CLS, PDM, and RZR will be
including the BallotGen program in their releases as well. 
</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>The system is
designed so that everyone gets to vote just once for their favorite game,
because email addresses will be recorded with ballots. The email address for
sending in ballots (in case anyone wants to know ahead of time) will be
trguild@hotmail.com. If you have any questions about the Games of the Year
project just send a letter to the same address, or stop by #TRG on EFNet.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>Anxious to find out
which game is going to take the title of  Game of the Year in its category?
FKrueger, leader of TRG, offers his favorites:<br><br> <i><font size="+1">"I'm
a big sports fan, so I'd probably have to say that NHL 98 is the best Sports
Game of the Year. I'd have to say that XCom 3 would be my choice for Strategy
Game of the Year, and probably Quake 2 for Action Game of the Year... but that's
not set in stone =)."</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>TRG is also planing
to begin releasing monthly reports on the scene sometime in the near future. TRG
has tried to fill the void left by The Paki Reports before, so the idea is
nothing new, but the reliability of the release dates may be. FKrueger said that
TRG has <br><br><i><font size="+1">"tried to release monthly reports a
couple of times this year. The most recent attempt was going well, until the
editor of it fried his modem. He hasn't been online since. We received a lot of
feedback on it though, and we will definitely try to be more consistent in
releasing those monthly reports."</font></i>
</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>Innovation and
consistency are hard to mix, but TRG's track record indicates that its got a
good chance. Expect more from TRG and its outstanding members in the future.
