        <td width="500"><font face="Arial" size="2">Well to be
        honest, as opposed to lying, the government is going to
        come out with a shitload of new "rules and
        regulations" for "fair" netplay and ways
        of conduct and all that kind of crap. And just like in
        the past, people are going to oppose it and say shit
        about "First Amendment Rights", etc. Basically,
        as more and more people start realizing the &lt;oohh, I
        just farted, excuse me benefits and need for computers, a
        lot more people are going to be online and that just
        means more people who might try to pirate or do other
        "bad" stuff. Depending on whether or not the
        increase in population on the net effects the profits of
        companies will depend on whether or not the Government
        takes action (as if you couldn't havefigured that one out
        yourself as you sit there saying to me "What a
        retard"). Anyway, eventually, things are going to
        get VERY VERY tight. Meaning you won't be able to get
        away with the shit you're doing now, so enjoy it while it
        lasts. But it's going to be a slow process, and maybe
        you'll die of a heart attack or cancer before it happens.
        Because the government is as slow as a terminal diseases
        sometimes. Excuse me, I have to go pee.</font></td>

        Brasco on the major couriers. And if they ever get to it,
        they'll fucking bust some caps in the people who are
        obtaining the shit. Obviously, these people will react in

        much different from last year. HOWEVER, I PREDICT, in 1
        and 3/4 years, there will be a MAJOR difference, b/c it's
        in that 3/4 of a year that major shit will go down, my
        Psychic Friend from the hotline told me so. Honestly,
        nothing much will happen, that will effect us in one year

        have to say, just don't try to advertise to SPA Agents
        &lt;if that's what they are called&gt; that you pirate or
        do bad stuff. I REPEAT, DO NOT CALL UP THE SPA AND SAY
        "I PIRATE, COME ARREST ME". Also, don't
        advertise to your friends how you get games "for
        free" b/c that will just cause an increase of
        "leechers" who have nothing to contribute to
        the scene as a whole and in essence will cause laws like
        "the NET" &lt;bad movie&gt; "Act" to
        increase and become even more strict.<br>
        <br>
        PS I'd like to give a *SHOUT OUT* to all the deaf people
        who have a hard time hearing people.<br>
