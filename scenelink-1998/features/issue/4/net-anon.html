        puts it in full force. When people see thier friends
        lying in jail, doing hard time, THEN it will seriously
        tear apart the net scene. Will it stop the people who
        have cd burners and make copies for thier friends? Not a

        will be the first to disappear, then major suppliers
        &amp; group leaders will be the first to be questioned,
        probably arrested. The thing is, the main way the feds
        get info is by publicity, and maybe by getting on the
        sites. But they can't get inside the groups and be a part
        of it. That's entrapment. They are breaking the law to be
        with us. After talking to people effected by CyberStrike,
        the questions the feds came up with were from reading
        .nfo files, they were clueless.</font></td>

        gets convicted, then there are going to be serious
        repracussions. The people who are apart of it will drop
        like flies. But what I don't understand is why go after
        us? We do it for fun, we do it to try out the software. I
        found it funny with Quake 2, people without cd-roms were
        able to play the game because of the scene. And you know
        what, people went out and bought cdroms &amp; quake 2 cuz
        they played it and said, "This is really cool."</font></td>
