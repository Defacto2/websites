<p align="left"><font face="arial"><font size="+2">A</font>n iso is basically
a snapshot image of a CD saved to file.  If created properly, it contains and
preserves all file creation dates, CD labels, attributes, etc.  Anyone with the
proper equipment (a CDR and any decent CDR burning utility) has the ability to
create their own iso images and to burn other iso images to CD.

<p align="left"><font face="arial"><strong>Enter the "iso scene":</strong><br><font color="#ffffff">»»»</font><font color="#000040">One day,
Pirate1 figured out that he could transfer his iso image of GameX to Pirate2
over the internet where Pirate2 could then burn the image and essentially have
an exact duplicate of the original! </font><br><br><font color="#ffffff">»»»</font><font color="#000080"> Imagine the possibilities...</font> to share one massive CD
collection with all of the greater pirate community.  PC games, utils, and
console games can all be traded the same way.  Expand your PSX or Saturn
collection for the mere cost of a blank CD ($2).  Download company patches and
version upgrades without worrying about compatibility with your rip.  Get the
latest programming/graphics utils with full online docs and examples (finally!)
instead of seeing them ripped out.  Build a massive CD library and be the envy
of all the other kids on your street!

<p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">»»»</font><font face="arial"><font color="#000080">Of course there are some stumbling blocks
in this very young scene.</font>  The image files are massive - usually around
<b>615 megs</b>.  This leaves the thousands of people still stuck on dial-up
connections out in the cold.  Download times are about 1-2 hours with average
speeds to many resnet traders and less to people using fast cable modems.  It is
standard practice to rar the image into 15 meg chunks, but most ftp server
daemons are written assuming incoming files will be zipped.  Compression has to
be disabled when rar'ing as well to save time on both ends when dealing with
such a massive file.  There are still very hazy standards on what format is best
to use when creating images (there are many) mostly because different utilities
support different CDRs.  There is also a lack of good informative nfo files,
with most nfos either MIA or looking like a 20 second slap-together job.  It
only takes a few minutes to put together a good nfo and can save a lot of people
a lot of time and headaches...
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">»»»</font><font face="arial"><font color="#000080">As it stands now, the majority of the iso
scene is made up of independent traders.</font>  There has been some recent
group formation but nobody is really dominating.  One of the reasons for this is
the nature of isos themselves; no cracking expertise is required to make and
trade isos.  The whole concept of the <em>0-day</em> group hierarchy loses its
meaning when any lamer with a CDR can do what they can.  Some <em>0-day</em>
supporters feel threatened; they see the iso scene as stripping away the "creativity"
and "artistic" nature of the <em>0-day</em> scene.  There will always
be a need for <em>0-day</em> releases and rips because not everything deserves
or needs to be traded as an iso.  And there will still be a need for dongle
crackers, because sometimes it's not enough to just have the CD.  A few notable
<em>0-day</em> groups have been testing the waters recently - <strong>RAZOR</strong>
and <strong>RiSC</strong> have created iso divisions within their groups. 
<strong>CIFE</strong> is another crew worth mentioning with some experienced
scene members bringing a bit of tradition to the young iso scene.  Look for more
release crews to start putting out isos in the next year.
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">»»»</font><font face="arial"><font color="#000080">Overall the pros far outweigh the cons of
isos.</font>  There will not be any serious growth to the scene, however, until
the bandwidth problem is resolved.  As more and more people migrate to<em> ADSL</em>
or <em>cable modems</em> or <em>Tx</em> connections, the scene will continue
to grow.  Things should be pretty lean over the summer as all the resnet traders
disappear, but look for an iso explosion in late 98.  CDR prices also continue
to plummet, making the units commonplace.  It will be interesting to see the
impact of DVD drives on the whole game industry.  It is quite reasonable to
expect many companies to migrate to another format that is harder/more work to
duplicate if the practice of iso trading really takes off.  Regardless, there
are good things in store for all the iso'ers abroad.
