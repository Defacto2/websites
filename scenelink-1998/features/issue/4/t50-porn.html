IMPORTANT AND URGENT ANNOUNCEMENT!
</font><p>
<font size="5" face="arial" color="#ffff00"><font size="3" face="arial" color="#ffffff">
We have never allowed XXX Password sites to participate in the Top50
but we have found that some of you have XXX password sections. Over the
next day we will be removing you from the list unless you remove your
xxx passwords and/or any links to other sites with xxx
passwords...ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS!
</font></font></p><p>
<font size="5" face="arial" color="#ffff00"><font size="3" face="arial" color="#ffffff">XXX
Password trading hurts the adult entertainment industry - and for many
of us it is adult sites who we earn money from with banner ads. <br>Does this not make sense to you? Think about it!
</font></font></p><p>
<font size="5" face="arial" color="#ffff00"><font size="3" face="arial" color="#ffffff">Adult
sites would have no problem with warez if you did not have xxx
passwords! I am receiving pressure from sponsors as well as threats and
attacts from adult webmasters because some of you have such content and
I am providing links to you. </font></font></p><p>
<font size="5" face="arial" color="#ffff00"><font size="3" face="arial" color="#ffffff">If you dissagree with me on this then fine - <br>but you absolutely can NOT participate in the Top50!
</font></font></p><p>

<font size="5" face="arial" color="#ffff00"><font size="3" face="arial" color="#ffffff">I
dont have time to send out emails giving warnings. We are going thru
the list now and if we find xxx password content of any kind - we have
to delete your account. If you remove all xxx password content, and
links to password content (this includes links to other sites password
sections!) then you may rejoin.
Send me an email with your account number notifying me that your XXX
password stuff is gone, and once verified your account will be
reactivated immediately. </font></font></p><p>
<font size="5" face="arial" color="#ffff00"><font size="3" face="arial" color="#ffffff">Please understand that this is in the best interest of everyone. Look at the plus side:
</font></font></p></center>
<font size="5" face="arial" color="#ffff00"><font size="3" face="arial" color="#ffffff"><br><li> Since no one on the list has passwds to offer, u wont see any difference in traffic.
<br></li><li> One less thing for you to update! Whoo hoo!
<br></li><li> Less email to sort thru. 
<br></li><li> Keep your sponsors!
<br></li><li> Most of the passwords never worked anyway!
<br></li><li> Still get listed with the Top50 and Top100 Sites.
<br></li><li> Adult sites wont get pissed and leech all ur bandwith. Its happening!
<br></li><li> etc..etc..etc...

<p>
Please note that the The Top100 Warez Sites is also making the same rule.
