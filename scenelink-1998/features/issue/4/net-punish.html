        government's actions concerning piracy will change over
        the next year? </strong></font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="500"><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, seeing
        that piracy has become a very prominent and much more
        blatant crime in the 90's, I don't see how anyone can be
        surprised at the response the government has had. The
        software entertainment industry is reaping in 8+ billion
        dollars a year now. According to an estimate by the SPA,
        flagrant piracy is costing some prominent software
        publishers around 1.6 billion dollars a year. Yep, you
        heard me... billion. Now if that's not a lot of copies of
        Quake 2, I don't know what is. The government has become
        very active in trying to enforce this, cyberstrike is
        nothing new. Back in 1994 a large series of busts
        occurred in which BBB's like The Assassins Guild, Agents
        of Fortune, The Network, Elm Street, Suburbia (big shock
        to us locals), and many others were shut down. I can only
        foresee that things will be getting worse. The
        "scene" is becoming flooding with people that
        have no real interests here, and just want to either
        mooch off of others, or stir up some trouble. I
        personally can't possibly see anything getting better.</font></td>

    <tr>
        <td width="500"><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, the
        traditional approach has been to bust the BBS' or FTP
        SITE owners. However, the new law targets anyone with 10
        or more copies of illegal software in their possession,
        which means just about anyone in the "scene."
        Couriers, suppliers, crackers, leechers everyone...
        personally I think they will remain as dull as usual and
        go after BBS owners/FTP sites.</font></td>

        <td width="500"><font face="Arial" size="2">It's a
        snowball effect, people get popped and they don't want to
        make friends with an ape in prison shoving in large
        objects from behind. So, they decide to give up some of
        their cyberfriends. (Think hard about it, how many people
        in the scene do you actually know?) I would suspect very
        few, I am fortunate or unfortunate enough (depending on
        how you look at it), to have met several of the people I
        talk to or deal with on a daily basis. Not many people
        can say the same...</font></td>

        saying that goes well with this... "The more things

        thing I see happening is games getting bigger, quality
        getting poorer, and competition getting more and more
        ruthless. It's turning into big business instead of a
        hobby... bad bad sign.</font></td>

        course, who am I to tell anyone what to do... these are
