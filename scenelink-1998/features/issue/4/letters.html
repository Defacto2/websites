<br><br>&gt; First off, my personal apologies. Scenelink exists as an
information source &gt; for internet art, music, and piracy, but the latter is
not in any way
<br>&gt; supported by our site directly. 
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; I'm grateful that you pointed out the file residing on our system, as
these &gt; kinds of problems could obviously be a little more difficult to
explain to &gt; proper authorities. The pirated file was not put there by myself
or any &gt; other member of scenelink. 
<br><br><font color="#000080">But you are responsible for everything happens
under your domain.
</font><br><br>&gt; It was in a dir which belonged to someone doing
<br>&gt; freelance work for us on an art gallery. Rest assured this person will
be
<br>&gt; questioned about the file. If it was made accessible to the public,
they
<br>&gt; will be removed from our system.
<br><br><font color="#000080">I hope so.</font> <br><br>&gt; feel free to
contact me further about this matter, I'd be interested in
<br>&gt; hearing what you thought of scenelink.
<br>&gt; To contact me directly, email neofish9@scenelink.org or call
xxx-xxx-xxxx
<br><br><font color="#000080">Please take this warning serious since
Fraunhofer headquarters is currently worldwide prosecuting all kinds of
copyright violation and criminal offence.
<br><br>In order to limit the damage, we ask you again to  
<br><br>* Immediately close access to the mentioned URL(s)
<br>* Backup all relevant user data for further investigation  by legal
authorities<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Jochen Fruehauf,
