<td><font face="arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
part of Scenelink's ongoing commitment to document the history of the scene, we
present an article featuring one of the legendary groups of the Commodore 64
scene.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thinking back to
the days of the Commodore 64, many groups come to mind: Fairlight, WCC, the
Byterapers, Eaglesoft, and, perhaps the most famous, Triad. The group was formed
in July of 1986 from a loose coalition of three other groups (3001, COD, and 
Mr. Z of SND).  Ixion, who was integral in organizing Triad, soon became its
leader.  A few weeks later in August of 1986, a short intro was released to
officially announce the birth of Triad.  
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon the three parts of a
successful group were in place.  First, there was a steady supply of originals
from members who worked in the software industry.  Triad also had many well
known and respected crackers working for it (most notably, Mr. Z). Finally,
Triad members had contacts around the world to whom they could spread their
releases.  With the key elements in place, Triad flourished.  Over the next
several years, hundreds of games were released to the hungry masses. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triad suffered a near
critical setback in 1988 when Ixion retired as founder and leader. For a couple
of months it appeared Triad may die.  However, 801 DC stepped up as interim
leader and kept the fire burning.  Jerry joined 2 months later as leader and
continues to this day as the main organizer of Triad.  Triad continues to be
active in the C=64 scene today.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our interview is with King
Fisher of Triad.  After belonging to such groups as the Byterapers and Royalty,
he was invited to join the Triad team as a coder and cracker.  He is responsible
for maintaining the <a href="http://www.df.lth.se/%7Etriad/triad/">Triad homepage</a>,
and continues to play a critical role in the Triad organization.

<tr>
<td><font face="arial" size="2">The people. No doubt. Whereas the relation
between me and my machine was sort of formal, the people I met through the Scene
made a lasting impression. It also learnt me what a society is, and that if
there is enthusiasm enough, you can do without money and hierarchies.

who would you say were the major players in the scene at the time?

<tr>
<td><font face="arial" size="2">Well I really didn't have the perspective of "major
players" or "elites" towards anyone. If somebody did something
interesting or was an interesting person, I would notice that, perhaps have a
chat with them at a copyparty. Looking back, the typically "adolescent"
or "growing up" attitude you had back then is sort of cute. I mean all
these "the w0rlds number 0ne", "phear us" etc, it was rather
harmless after all. You just were not such a critical mind at the time, and I
really can't remember if I actually believed these people to be superior in any
way...

Triad's success in the scene? 
</b></font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="arial" size="2">They were at the right place at the right time
with the right people. It was as simple as that. Also the name was great. Ixion,
the founder, was also a bit older than the rest and had a lot of good ideas.
Then Jerry took over Triad and he was a firm force always finding new good
members as the old ones left, much the same way that Ixion recruited Janitor
when Mr.Z decided to quit.

<tr>
<td><font face="arial" size="2">I still do. However a bit lazily from time to
time. To me everything has mixed up, I cannot separate the people doing the C64
business from the guys trading PC warez and MP3. I have a tendency to follow
every new trend there is... The Scene nowadays is Internetbased whereas it used
to be board / mailswap based. That changes everything.

<tr>

Smart (Triad), Ian (Fusion), Honey (1001 Crew), White (Judges), PHS (CCS), TMC
aka Charles Deenen and the Eaglesoft guys. (I didn't really think this over very
deeply.)

<td bgcolor="#004080"><font color="#ffffff"><b>Can you describe the typical
release of the C=64 days?
</b></font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="arial" size="2">It varied over time. The typical release for
us was a good cracked, good packed, good trained and quite fast one with a tiny
intro. Some other guy's releases weren't that good, just faster. Other guys also
added FAT UGLY intros. (Some were fat and cute.)
</font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#004080"><font color="#ffffff"><b>Where did you get most of your
releases? 
</b></font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="arial" size="2">It varied. From contacts mostly, some I
bought.

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#004080"><font color="#ffffff"><b>How aware do you think that
law enforcement was to what groups like Triad were doing?
</b></font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="arial" size="2">Police you know... They don't know computers
that well. Before the 1985 movie War Games they didn't even know you could do
anything with computers. Then they formed expertise to counter netrunners,
network intruders. There was no court cases on piracy in Sweden until 1989. That
was when it was outlawed here too. I know other countries had this kind of
police earlier... Also the police didn't give a shit about crackers, the only
thing that bothered them were the pirates that sold games on the black market.
They understood very well that the people cracking and the people selling the
games were not the same. 
<br><br>The police didn't care about Triad. However the software importers
did. But that is a totally different story...

disliked most about the scene? Any particular  groups or  people that you just
couldn't stand?

<td><font face="arial" size="2">I could stand all groups. Some people you
know, they are not mentally sane. That kind of people you will find all the way
through your life, and well, I don't want to name them. They have trouble enough
as it is already.

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#004080"><font color="#ffffff"><b>Finally, is there life after
the C=64? &lt;grin&gt;
</b></font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="arial" size="2">There was life after the Apple II so ther must
be life after the C64. Actually I don't understand why people say the PC scene
sucks and so. It is not worse, just different. I guess some guys hate that they
will have to start from scratch in order to enter the new scenes, and that is
why they always proclaim the C64 Scene to have been "better". I try to
keep pace with my time and join everything new that comes up. To me it is not a
case of "either-or" but rather "both-and".
