The last issue scenelink ever produced. Once again, the lead story was on the
effect of the NET act, this time we obtained an interview with the SPA's latest
victim who revealed that even though the NET act had passed 3 months earlier, he
had been accused under previously existing legislation. Also included were
articles on the biggest warez market in Eastern Europe, Scenecon #1, and
Relativity's public emag viewer.

<td width="340"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><tt>Issue 5 February 98</tt></b><br>
The truth about ChinaBlue, more than just an angry tirade against Xforce, the
article offered both sides of the conflict and gave people a chance to publicly
thank ChinaBlue for her time in the scene. Also included were articles on ISO
standards, an interview with the former leader of INC, an interview with a
coordinator of scene.org, and an introduction to dupe checks.

<td width="340"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><tt>Issue 4 January 98</tt></b><br>
Another exhaustive feature on the NET act. This time, we collected responses
from 10 people at varying levels of the warez scene. Also included were articles
on the birth of the ISO scene, TRG's game of the year project, and a musing on
warez ethics. <a href="../features/issue/4/features.html">[read

<td width="340"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><tt>Issue 3 December 97</tt></b><br>
 This was the first issue that provided really useful information to people in
the scenes. Our coverage of the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act was probably,
without too much exaggeration, the most in-depth look anywhere into what the new
law would mean for people in the warez scene. Also included were articles on the
warez scene in Eastern Europe, the warez magazine SYN (that never published a
single issue), and the ravings of a lunatic who likened warez trading to the
civil disobedience Rosa Parks.

<td width="340"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><tt>Issue 2 September 97</tt></b><br>
 The last bi-weekly issue we tried to do. I like to think we learned quickly.
Articles on the death of Amnesia, the agrajag cheat program, lit.org, and why
software ownership is bad for society.  <br>
