<td><font face="arial" size="2">This was the 4th HiP, but it was really
nothing like the others. In past years, crowds rarely topped 50, and security
concerns kept publicity low. Everything is changing now. By September of 97,
hacking was becoming so popular in Poland that the main organizers (morbius and
wiedzmin) decided to completely change the way this year's HiP would be run.
After they announced some of the changes, hackers started to come to them and
offer to lecture on what they knew. Of course, there were still a lot of
problems to resolve, like how to provide hardware, accommodations, and an area
for mass media.  <br>Fortunately they found a sponsor early on. </font>

private computer company in Eastern Europe, agreed to provide the hardware (20
computers Pentium MMX) while Telekomunikacja Polska S.A (a large Polish
telecommunication monopoly) wanted to become the primary sponsor.  Even though
it meant a lot less money to work with, organizers decided to turn down TPSA's
offer. In addition to being hated in Poland, (its services were the worst in all
Europe, AND the most expensive) TPSA had said that they would not support the
event if phreakers were allowed to lecture. <br>Many people asked, "why
have it in Belchatow? It's so small." The reasons were simple. Renting the
space there was cheap, and security wasn't a problem (local police don't know
anything about hacking and phreaking). Some people wanted the event to be in
Warsaw, in "Piwnica" - the most popular pub there, but everything
would have been a lot more expensive. Although the space in Belchatow was a
little small, (it usually holds 100 people but crowds reached 200 during
speeches) it felt more cozy than cramped.

<tr>
<td><font face="arial" size="2">HiP was the first time that Polish hackers got
a chance to meet each other and share their experiences. In my opinion that was
the most important aspect of the party. Many hackers met each other for the
first time at HiP, but I'm sure a lot of people will meet again soon. <br>Lectures
were another important aspect of HiP. The general schedule was: 11oo - 18oo
lectures, presentations, practice, and 20oo - ???? private meetings of different
hackers, practice. Most speeches discussed either Windows 95/NT or Unix/Linux
systems.  <br>Some of the topics included: "How to obviate firewall in
Windows 95/NT system," "Sites sniffing," "Finding new bugs
in fresh protect-system patches," "Scanning Linux source by own
algorithms," "Hacking Domestic nets and intranets," "Carding
- how to not be caught," "Carding - protect your credit card," "Phreaking
on public phones using silver box or spoon," "Phreaking from house -
forget about boxes," "How to hack without practice knowledge - social
engineering," etc.... </font>

<td><font face="arial" size="1">HiP had great reviews in press and TV. All
journalist had really               good play on HiP. People from different mass
media were authorized              to go on the most of HiP meetings, lectures
and parties. Special                for journalist HiP organizers prepared small
bar. Every journalist              had one beer for free ;)</font></td>
<td valign="top"><font face="arial" size="1">Due to the most of journalists
were quite young (20-30 years) they              wanted to play. Special for
them HiP organizers installed Quake2,              Need for Speed 2 and other
games. Of course all of games were              original ;)</font></td></tr></tbody></table><font face="arial" size="2">All of them were very interesting and even professional
hackers and phreakers heard new things.  <br>The day before HiP, Polish
journalists had been saying, "with so many hackers together, they're bound
to hack something." They were right. None of the incidents were planned by
HiP organizers, but hackers are always looking for a new challenge. <br>Belchatow
is very small town and its telecommunication service is one of the lowest in
Poland. Calling for free from public phones is easy (I checked it ;) ). A lot of
people spent the day calling distant nations and 0-700-xxxx numbers, wasting at
least $2,000 a day in phone service. Later, a few hackers, using a Laptop and a
public phone, hacked TPSA's internet server. TPSA workers and police arrived and
interrogated many guests (not just the hackers). Nobody found anything, probably
because most of the hackers stayed in hotel rooms they'd booked for the event.
<br>Hackers were happy to talk with journalists, but only at HiP. Outside the
con, they wanted to be away from the media. The hacking community is a lot like
the warez scene. They don't want to be "too famous." If everybody
knows who you are, it's dangerous, and fame isn't really necessary amyway. The
media did a pretty good job reporting on HiP. Most of the articles were fairly
unbiased, and some of them were pretty interesting.

Organizers announced that because of the huge turnout they got this year, HiP
'99 will be held in a bigger city, with a bigger space, and be even more well
publicized. The most important thing was that people got a chance to meet face
to face people they'd known for a long time only as irc nicks. The party also
helped expose young people to the h/p/a/v/c/s scene. In my opinion, HiP'98 was a
special event in Polish scene history. There have been other parties, like "Intel
Outside" or "Proba Generalna," but they were only connected to
the demoscene. HiP'98 was the first big, public party for people hackers.

200 auditors at              average. Chairs were rent from nearby secondary
school. </font></td></tr></tbody></table><font face="arial" size="2">HiP was important
for a lot of people. Even people that didn't consider themselves hackers enjoyed
being a part of the event. There's been talk about organizing more events like
HiP, not just for hackers, but for phreakers, crackers and carders. <br>Although
Poland and other Eastern Europe countries have ancient telecommunication
services, internet services are quickly catching up with Western Europe. By 1999
it's estimated that 10% of Polish people will have internet connections through
Cable TV (fast and quite cheap). Faster, and more available connections will
naturally effect the scene a great deal. More people will have access to the
scene, and meetings like HiP will help introduce them. On the other hand, more
people will mean more attention from the police. In Poland, a lot of people
think of a hacker as a person who spends all their time searching for free XXX
sites and destroying servers. Changing this stereotype is just one more reason
for organizing more meetings like HiP. 
<br><br>In summary I can say that the future of hacking in Poland looks pretty
good. Advances in computers and the internet will help, but what happens to
hacking in the future is more about people than technology.
