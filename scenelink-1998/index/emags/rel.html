Relativity Productions has been re-organized and we are looking for WRITERS
ONLY! Anyone else who wants to join in any other positions besides WRITER will
not be accepted. We just want more reading material to be generated. We are
releasing every 3 weeks now no matter how much content there is because everyone
got tired of waiting. It's time to get the ball on the roll again and after
almost a year and a half in the scene we WILL NOT let it die. Come to
#relativity on efnet and speak to En|{rypt or MuadDib about joining the group.
Also, if you can provide services for the group such as being able to make hats,
t-shirts, etc. for us using our electronic art you are welcome to help us out!
If you can provide any other services that are not specified in the NFO and you
would wish to pursue, please speak to En|{rypt or MuadDib or simply email
<a href="mailto:muaddib@usa.net">muaddib@usa.net</a>. <br><br></td></tr>

I would like to say thank you to all the groups that have been in the scene for
so long since old skool days. They include groups such as FLT/HYBRID/RAZOR which
do interviews with us and enlighten our minds about the REAL SCENE and not what
it has become in recent years. Thank you all!

Rumours are going around that Affinity Emag is still the only real warez emag
around and it is TRUE. Relativity is NOT a warez emag because we write about
anything and everything we can aquire and/or produce. If you think we are just
about warez you are dead wrong. Don't judge us based on rumours, find out the
truth because it just goes to show you how lame the scene has become. At least
we are trying to bring some promise to the scene and we do this as a HOBBY. It
is for just having fun! Remember that! Don't make the scene a drag... <br><br></td></tr>
