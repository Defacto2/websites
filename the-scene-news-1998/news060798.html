Hybrid the kings of soccer related releases has decided to bless us with their first and probably only release for this quarter. Premier Manager 98 (c) Gremlin Interactive.
<p>
Well we knew someone would eventually have do to it. RC had to go and release a raped version of Final Fantasy 7, but alas it's still too big. Then to follow this, a group called Rough also released a dupe of the nuked FF7. If that wasn't enough they then followed it up with a separate Music and Sound addon, looks like they where trying to do an old Paradigm trick to me.
<p>
It seems TKLP and some other Divine members where not too happy with a some of the bad titles DVN seems to dish out. So TKLP in his divine wisdom has unfortunately reformed Reflux, a bold move in my opinion to out crap DVN at crap releases. Reflux has already gotten off to a great start with their first release being shareware.
<p>
Divine are obviously not to happy with this split. Here is what they say in their newest release NFO file which ironically is a fix for a Reflux release no less.<br>

 ³  Yes, Reflux is back! After we all celebrated the day the most lame group ³
 ³  ever decided to part from the scene, they decided to come back. And one  ³
 ³  of their first releases stands up to their normal quality. Looks like    ³
 ³  they managed to find the one cracker in the world who doesn't know shit  ³
 ³  about rerouting.                                                         ³
 ³  As this reflux release got paid for with Divine funds (yes, it's shocking³
 ³  but true), we felt we needed to give the public this fix to take care of ³
 ³  that.                                                                    ³

Class have admitted releasing a beta version of Rampage World Tour and has subsequently released the store version. Here is what they have to say in their CLASS.NFO.<p>
<center><pre>
º Additional Info:                                                           º
º Okay, so Class screwed up. We admit it (see moonlord, we do admit these    º
º things). While their are differences in the .EXE, their are hardly any     º
º other differences found. What is really REALLY fucked up is that EVEN IN   º
º THE STORE FINAL, in the ABOUT section it says beta. Why Midway did this, isº
º beyond our reasoning, and its not our fault. You should bitch at Midway forº
º misleading gamers in thinking they are getting a beta version when they areº
º in fact playing the final version. If you don't believe me that in fact    º
º WHAT YOU'RE GETTING IS THE STORE FINAL, then go to your favorite retail    º
º chain, pick up the game and check it out for yourself (Look for the black  º
º box with a picture of the characters of Rampage on the front. Everything   º
º from the back of the box has been copied into this nfo). The reason why we º
º we didn't do a final patch is because it was nuked on most sites and it'd  º
º be best to give the entire game to the scene. A directory listing of the   º
º final cd BEFORE installation is included in the zip files. BTW: A directoryº
º listing of both of our releases can be found in the game.                  º

I was a bit slow picking up on this. Motiv8 the group with the reputation of being a scene bootcamp for couriers was reformed last month (29th). It seems it has the approval of Mason too.

Class's release of of Rampage World Tour (45 disks) is a beta. If you goto the About menu it says "COMPILED: 03-09-98, 16:15:54 (Beta)". I wondered what happened to Class's quality control?

Also as a side note apparently the key Divine is offering will not work on the DOS version of AntiViral Pro. You should use the original key that came with the program. You will need to use the DOS version of the cleaner if your \windows .exe files have been infected. Because if the .exe files are in use while Windows is running they can not be cleaned.

Slow news month this month, but you know the cliche. No news is good news, usually right for the scene. Anyway TheSystem/Razor 1911's new electronic magazine has been delayed until August due to some coding problems. Hetero had some problems with the win32 code and so he has been replaced with Strech.

Well just my luck, I stay up till 2.30am (Im Australian) to join in on the first ever SSA meeting. A lot of people where in the channel including myself waiting for the meeting get started when my ISP disconnects me. Im left out in the cold due to a thunderstorm with no chance of reconnecting, I was anything but please. So if you want a detailed report on the event I suggest visiting Scenelink.
