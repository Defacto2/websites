You must really wonder about Divine sometimes. Today they release NFL GameDay '99 (c) 989 Studios which was way over the disk limit. They claimed that it was impossible to make it any smaller without ripping out all the sfx. Then Class comes along a little while after and discovers there is a massive Play-by-Play commentary file that can be removed thus reducing the total release size down to only 34 disks.
<p>
In a bid to go more main stream and expand Game Over Online (the guys who review warez releases) have removed all references to the pirate scene on all their pages. This means no more online NFO's or release listings which contain the group's name. Is this the start of Game Over turning commerical, ignoring the scene in a bid to make a profit like Acid and Ice did in the early nineties?
<p>
Vindicator from the Phrozen Crew sent me a letter saying that he used to run www.warezregulator.com aka Warez News, but after a few months rest he has returned, but changed the url to www.twofast.com

Congratulations to CLASS who celebrate their 300th release today with BASS Masters Classic: Tournament Edition. Contained in this release is a large NFO file with some words from Class to commemorate this achievement and a list of their 300 releases to date.<p>
Razor 1911 have finally got their webpage back online at www.razor1911.com. Unfortunately nothing has been updated on it since it went down last year.<p>
Trite's pheared.com is down till tommorow though I bet it could take it a little longer to return.<p>
Scenelink are claiming that Legends Never Die (who have seemed to have done just that) have merged into Siege.

Version 1.0 of Qapla's Quick Packer is now available.<br>

Trite's pheared.com has returned with all it's pages including Black Acid's infamous T.C.A.<p>
Could Class be unofficially restarting the trend of releasing documents? In the old days most groups retyped the manuals, but no one could be bothered doing that these days. But scanning them and converting them to a Adobe PDF format is a viable option and that’s what Class has done with Spearhead_Dox-CLS.<p>

MileStone one of the best sites in the world has announced that it will be returning very shortly. MS has been down for over a month.<p>

The Scene News is proud to announce we have created the first desktop ticker (or any desktop item) for the scene. This ticker will automatically send updates of the latest news happenings directly from The Scene News to your desktop. The only software you need to use this feature is Internet Explorer 4+ (any o/s version). To enable the ticker click the orange button above.<p>
Also we are pleased to annouce that the server Defacto2.net now has it's own IE Channel, another scene first. If you have Internet Explorer 4 (any o/s version) just click the blue button above to enable the channel.<p>

Talk about a dull month, I still don't have anything interesting scene wise for you. But some of you will be glad to hear that defacto2.net will be implementing an Internet Explorer Channel soon. So people with perminate connections will be able to get the news as soon as it happens (or as soon as I write it).<p>

Razor and Paradigm have done it with golf games, now Paradigm is doing it to a racing game. What am I talking about? Releasing a game crippled and then releasing the missing levels (in this case tracks) as an additional addon in a bid to work around the disk limit. Why bother with a disk limit at all?
