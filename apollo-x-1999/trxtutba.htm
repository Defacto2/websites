is possibly the most difficult part of tracking, and it's <br>
where most people give up.The key is perseverance and practice. Listen to what others <br>
have to say about your initial attempts, but only listen if you know you'll get an <br>
honest opinion from them. Take on board any criticism, and use it to your advantage. <br>

software that allows music to be made using only <br>
a computer and some sound samples.&nbsp; These sound samples are then played <br>
back at varying pitches and with various effects so as to produce music. <br>
The musical data used to describe how to play each note is arranged in <br>
a list like form, as shown below.<br>

up the screen, and when it passes the cursor it gets processed <br>
and played.Not all trackers have this same layout; I've used FT2 above. <br>
<br>
Trackers produce files called modules, which is usually abbreviated to MOD.<br>
The term MOD originally meant a SoundTracker module, but over the years it has <br>
become a generic term for any type of module.MODs are a sort of hybrid MIDI/sample <br>
file.They contain sequencing information as well as the instruments (samples) that <br>
are used for playback. <br>
<br>
It's actually quite hard to give trackers and MODs a 'definition' that can be <br>
understood by everyone.If you have Internet access then do a search for 'MOD <br>
Trackers' and quite a number of definitions should pop up.</font><font

<u>-Choosing a tracker</u> </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">May as well start at the
beginning I suppose... <br>
Choosing a tracker to learn in is possibly the most important choice you can <br>
make. Some trackers have extremely difficult interfaces to learn, which, if you <br>
are only just starting out and have never used a tracker before, pose an <br>
additional aspect of learning that will need to be undertaken. <br>
<br>
There are six systems with trackers that I know of, classified as - <br>
- Amiga <br>
- DOS <br>
- Windows 3.1/95/NT <br>
- Mac <br>
- Unix/Linux/Sun/NeXT <br>
- Atari ST <br>
<br>
Obviously the system you own dictates what you can use, but the Amiga, Atari, <br>
and Mac based trackers are split up into a few different areas, depending on <br>
your hardware.Whatever tracker you decide on using, before you even start <br>
tracking with it, be sure to read the manual.Load a few alreadymade modules <br>
in so you can play around with the various features and find out how they <br>
work.Spend a day figuring out every feature of the tracker. <br>
<br>
The only way to find out what tracker is best for you is to try out a few <br>
and then decide. I would recommend that you choose a tracker that produces <br>
a standard module format for the platform you are producing on e.g. if you <br>
own an Amiga a MOD based tracker would be a good choice, on a PC an IT or <br>
XM tracker would be a good choice etc. Don't use a tracker just because <br>
someone else does, or because it offers more features.Go for the interface <br>
every time; if you can't use the trackers power then what's the point <br>
in having that power. <br>
<br>
Don't do what I do sometimes and use multiple trackers to produce one tune, <br>
doing that is not advised (if you're interested I use FT2 and IT, FT2 to <br>
do the bulk of the work, and IT to tidy up and add panning.I just find FT2 <br>
more intuitive).It makes work much harder, especially if you get something <br>
sounding perfect in one, only to find it sounds horrible in the other. </font><font

<u>-Choosing hardware</u></font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">The basic hardware
requirements to track are: - <br>
<br>
A computer - You probably already have one of these. If you don't, then <br>
how on earth are you reading this ? Your computer MUST have some sort of <br>
digital audio capabilities. If you have an Amiga, Atari, or Mac then you <br>
should be okay for now. If you have a PC (and by that I don't necessarily <br>
mean an IBM compatible) without a digital sound card of some description, <br>
then you're finished before you've even started. Go out and get one now! <br>
<br>
Monitoring Equipment - All that&#146;s needed is a pair of speakers and/or a pair <br>
of headphones. Since we're talking about basic requirements here, practically <br>
anything will do to get you started. </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3"

<u>-Getting Started</u> </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Ok, so you've got hold of a
tracker that you like the look and feel of, the <br>
next thing to do is to get hold of some samples and/or modules. These should <br>
preferably be in a style that you like and be of a reasonable quality. Just <br>
go to the Internet resources section for a list of places to look. If you don't <br>
have Internet access, then any local shareware libraries or BBS system should <br>
be able to sort you out with some. Samples are preferable to modules, but it's <br>
easy enough to rip the samples out of modules. Alternatively, you could sample <br>
your own sounds, but this can be quite difficult to do if you don't know what <br>
you generally use or need. As you don't yet know how to track properly yet, I <br>
would recommend you choose which to learn first, tracking or sampling. This will<br>
ease the learning curve. If you want to learn the key points to good sampling, <br>
skip to the sampling section. When you've finished that, come back here. </font><font

</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">First of all you'll need to
set up a few directories in which to store your <br>
music stuff.There are many different ways to do this, but I'll describe mine <br>
for you to have a base to build on. Obviously you don't have to follow this <br>
it's just to give you an idea of a structure. <br>
<br>
I use a separate partition for my music stuff. This brings such benefits <br>
as easy organisation and security from crashes on other partitions. <br>

This allows me quick access to the samples I want (I can remember what <br>
most of them are called and sound like). I also regularly clean out my sample<br>
collection by getting rid of any that are bad quality - clipped,noisy etc.<br>
Any that I'm unlikely to ever use, or I have already used and don't want to <br>
use again are also got rid of.<br>
<br>
I create a file in every directory called DETAILS.TXT, where I list each <br>
file contained in the directory, along with where I got it from.When you <br>
have thousands of samples, and you're trying to credit the authors,it saves <br>
a lot of time and much hair pulling to have the information in one place.<br>
<br>
I would recommend you start off by creating some sort of structure, it'll <br>
stop your disk getting cluttered and enable you to work more efficiently. <br>
If you're running off floppies then use separate disks for different types <br>
of samples, and regularly defragment and check for errors (this also applies <br>
for hard disk owners). </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
<u>-Let's Go</u> </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">By now you should have a
tracker you're happy with, some samples, and/or some <br>
modules. You're ready to begin being a tracker. I'm going to teach you how to <br>
produce a simple tune, and this should hopefully guide you as to what you <br>
should be doing. <br>
<br>
This can be done in two ways, either in step-time or in real-time. The majority<br>
of modules are produced in step-time, maybe with a small amount of real-time <br>
just to see roughly where the notes need to be placed. If you have a MIDI <br>
keyboard connected to your sound card, then you could use that to input the <br>
notes. Generally though, due to the harsh amount of quantitization that occurs <br>
with a tracker you are better off doing it in step-time. <br>
<br>
I would recommend that you try producing a few 4 channel modules first, use one <br>
channel for drums, one for bass, one for lead, and one for chords. This should <br>
help as you'll always be able to see what's going on, on the screen. If you <br>
find you do want to use more channels to begin with, then by all means go ahead,<br>
but bear in mind that most of the great tracker musicians today started <br>
on 4 channel modules... <br>
<br>
The best way to learn how to do something is to watch someone else do it. This <br>
applies to tracking as well. You can learn a lot just from listening to the <br>
great ones in the scene. If you come up with a tune idea and you know what <br>
you want it to sound like, it helps a lot to look for a tune from one of the <br>
masters that sounds similar to what you want to write, and listen to their <br>
tune over and over again. Look for the things they do with their tune that <br>
sets that tracker apart from the others in the scene, and if you can adapt <br>
their techniques into your song in an original way, do it. Start by writing <br>
music that you really like listening to - don't try and write an orchestral <br>
piece if you don't listen to it - it'll show. <br>
<br>
If you want to make a tune realistic, try to imagine how the instrument would <br>
be played. Pretend you are a musician when you write a part. Also, if you use <br>
an instrument such as a piano, try to use more than a single piano note - a <br>
real piano will have more than one note playing at a time - use some chords etc. <br>
<br>
Originally, people used to sample whole chords to save sample space. Now we've<br>
got these wonderful trackers with gazillions of channels. Constructing chords <br>
from notes because you have the space to do so gives a better and more a <br>
professional sound. However, be very careful! If you decide to construct a <br>
chord rather than use a single sample, some musicianship is required. Simple <br>
major chords are easy, but inversions really add to a piece. If you are able <br>
to do it this way,you'll get a professional, crafted sound. But it does take <br>
a long time before you'll get a smooth flowing part. <br>
<br>
For a nice fill to the sound, try to balance the usage of low and high <br>
frequencies, tunes with too much bass and too little treble sound rough,<br>
tunes with too much treble and too little bass sound insubstantial. </font><font

<br>
<u>-The Effects Commands</u> </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">By now you should be wanting
to experiment with some effects, to make your <br>
music more interesting and more professional. Before we start, lets just get <br>
something straight. Effects should only be used when they are needed. Using <br>
effects just because you can doesn't automatically improve the quality <br>
of your music. <br>
<br>
This section will only cover effects with letters/numbers that can be used <br>
in ProTracker MODs. Practically all trackers support these basic effects. <br>
However many trackers use different letters/numbers to represent the same <br>
effect, so check before trying anything. If you try an effect listed here <br>
and it produces a result completely different to how it is described here, <br>
then consult your trackers manual. Effects are typed into the rightmost <br>
column of each channel in every tracker. They consist of an effect command <br>
and a value. <br>
<br>
Different trackers have different letters and numbers for the same effect <br>
command. But pretty much all of them can work with hexadecimal for the <br>
value. If you don't know what Hex is, then the following extract, taken <br>
from the Impulse Tracker manual,should help. <br>
<br>
Instead of using a decimal system (i.e. base 10), it is more natural for <br>
the computer to work with hexadecimal (often abbreviated to simply 'Hex') <br>
- numbers which operate in base 16. The first 9 numbers in Hex are denoted <br>
by '1' to '9' and the next 6 are denoted by 'A' to 'F'. So if you count in <br>
Hex, it will be as follows: (0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, <br>
F, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 20, 21, <br>
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 2A etc. To convert a Hex number to decimal, <br>
multiply the 'tens' column by 16 and add the value of the second column <br>
i.e. 32 Hex = 3*16+2 = 50 decimal. 2A Hex = 2*16+10 = 42 (because A = 10). <br>
The maximum number that you can represent with two Hex digits is FF = 255 <br>
decimal. <br>
<br>
Let's start with the most basic effect, the Set Volume command: C. Input a <br>
note, then move the cursor to the effects command column and type a C. <br>
Play the pattern, and you shouldn't be able to hear the note you placed the <br>
C by. This is because the effect parameters are 00. Change the two zeros <br>
to a 40(Hex)/64(Dec), depending on what your tracker uses. Play back the <br>
pattern again, and the note should come in at full volume. <br>
<br>
The Position Jump command next. This is just a B followed by the position <br>
in the playing list that you want to jump to. One thing to remember is <br>
that the playing list always starts at 0, not 1. This command is <br>
usually in Hex. <br>
<br>
Onto the volume slide command: A. This is slightly more complex (much more <br>
if you're using a newer tracker, if you want to achieve the results here, <br>
then set slides to Amiga, not linear), due to the fact it depends on the <br>
secondary tempo. For now set a secondary tempo of 06 (you can play around <br>
later), load a long or looped sample and input a note or two. A few rows <br>
after a note type in the effect command A. For the parameters use 0F. <br>
Play back the pattern, and you should notice that when the effect kicks <br>
in, the sample drops to a very low volume very quickly. Change the effect <br>
parameters to F0, and use a low volume command on the note. Play back the <br>
pattern, and when the slide kicks in the volume of the note should increase <br>
very quickly. <br>
<br>
This because each part of the effect parameters for command A does a <br>
different thing. The first number slides the volume up,and the second slides<br>
it down. It's not recommended that you use both a volume up and volume down <br>
at the same time, due to the fact the tracker only looks for the first <br>
number that isn't set to 0. If you specify parameters of 8F, the tracker <br>
will see the 8,ignore the F, and slide the volume up. Using a slide up and <br>
down at same time just makes you look stupid. Don't do it... <br>
<br>
The Set Tempo command: F, is pretty easy to understand. You simply specify <br>
the BPM (in Hex) that you want to change to. One important thing to note is <br>
that values of lower than 20 (Hex) sets the secondary tempo rather <br>
than the primary. <br>
<br>
Another useful command is the Pattern Break: D. This will stop the playing <br>
of the current pattern and skip to the next one in the playing list. By <br>
using parameters of more than 00 you can also specify which line to begin <br>
playing from. <br>
<br>
Command 3 is Portamento to Note. This slides the currently playing note to <br>
another note, at a specified speed. The slide then stops when it reaches <br>
the desired note. The best way to describe this is to give an example. <br>
<br>
C-2 1 000 - Starts the note playing <br>
--- 000 <br>
C-3 330 - Starts the slide to C-6 at a speed of 30. <br>
--- 300 - Continues the slide <br>
--- 300 - Continues the slide <br>
One thing you can note about this and many other commands are that they <br>
have a memory. Once the parameters have been set, the command can be <br>
input again without any parameters, and it'll still perform the same <br>
function unless you change the parameters. This memory function allows <br>
certain commands to function correctly, such as command 5, which is the <br>
Portamento to Note and Volume Slide command. Once command 3 has been set <br>
up command 5 will simply take the parameters from that and perform a <br>
Portamento to Note. Any parameters set up for command 5 itself simply <br>
perform a Volume Slide identical to command A at the same time as the <br>
Portamento to Note. <br>
<br>
This memory function will only operate in the same channel where the <br>
original parameters were set up. There are various other commands <br>
which perform two functions at once; they will be described as we <br>
come across them. <br>
<br>
The next command we'll look at is the Portamento up/down: 1 and 2. <br>
Command 1 slides the pitch up at a specified speed,and 2 slides it <br>
down. This command works in a similar way to the volume slide, in that <br>
it is dependent on the secondary tempo. Both these commands have a <br>
memory dependent on each other, if you set the slide to a speed of 3 <br>
with the 1 command, a 2 command with no parameters will use the speed <br>
of 3 from the 1 command, and vice versa. <br>
<br>
Command 4 is Vibrato. Vibrato is basically rapid changes in pitch, just<br>
try it, and you'll see what I mean. Parameters are in the format of xy,<br>
where x is the speed of the slide, and y is the depth of the slide. <br>
One important point to remember is to keep your vibratos subtle and <br>
natural so a depth of 3 or less and a reasonably fast speed, around <br>
8, is usually used. Setting the depth too high can make the part <br>
sound out of tune from the rest. <br>
<br>
Following on from command 4 is command 6. This is the Vibrato and <br>
Volume Slide command, and it has a memory like command 5, which you <br>
already know how to use. <br>
<br>
Command 7 is Tremolo. This is similar to vibrato. Rather than <br>
changing the pitch it slides the volume. The effect parameters <br>
are in exactly the same format. <br>
<br>
Command 9 is Sample Offset. This starts the playback of the sample <br>
from a different place than the start. The effect parameters specify <br>
the sample offset, but only very roughly. Say you have a sample which<br>
is 8765(Hex) bytes long, and you wanted it to play from position <br>
4321(Hex). The effect parameter could only be as accurate as the <br>
43 part, and it would ignore the 21. <br>
<br>
Command B is the Playing List/Order Jump command . The parameters <br>
specify the position in the Playing List/Order to jump to. When <br>
used in conjunction with command D you can specify the position <br>
and the line to play from. <br>
<br>
Command E is pretty complex, as it is used for a lot of different <br>
things, depending on what the first parameter is. I will take you <br>
through each effect in order. <br>
<br>
Command E0 controls the hardware filter on an Amiga, which, as a <br>
low pass filter, cuts off the highest frequencies being played <br>
back. There are very few players and trackers on other system <br>
that simulate this function, not that you should need to use it. <br>
The second parameter, if set to 1, turns on the filter. If set to <br>
0, the filter gets turned off. <br>
<br>
Commands E1/E2 are Fine Portamento Up/Down . Exactly the same <br>
functions as commands 1/2, except that they only slide the pitch <br>
by a very small amount. These commands have a memory the same <br>
as 1/2 as well. <br>
<br>
Command E3 sets the Glissando control. If parameters are set to <br>
1 then when using command 3, any sliding will only use the notes <br>
in between the original note and the note being slid to. This <br>
produces a somewhat jumpier slide than usual. The best way to <br>
understand is to try it out for yourself. Produce a slow slide <br>
with command 3, listen to it, and then try using E31. <br>
<br>
Command E4 is the Set Vibrato Waveform control . This command <br>
controls how the vibrato command slides the pitch. Parameters <br>
are 0 - Sine, 1 - Ramp Down (Saw), 2 - Square. By adding 4 to <br>
the parameters, the waveform will not be restarted when a new <br>
note is played e.g. 5 - Sine without restart. <br>
<br>
Command E5 sets the Fine Tune of the instrument being played, but <br>
only for the particular note being played. It will override the <br>
default Fine Tune for the instrument. The parameters range from 0 to <br>
F, with 0 being -8 and F being +8 Fine Tune. A parameter of 8 gives <br>
no Fine Tune. If you're using a newer tracker that supports more <br>
than -8 to +8 e.g. -128 to +128, these parameters will give a rough <br>
Fine Tune, accurate to the nearest 16. <br>
<br>
Command E6 is the Jump Loop command. You mark the beginning of the <br>
part of a pattern that you want to loop with E60,and then specify <br>
with E6x the end of the loop, where x is the number of times you <br>
want it to loop. <br>
<br>
Command E7 is the Set Tremolo Waveform control . This has exactly <br>
the same parameters as command E4, except that it works for <br>
Tremolo rather than Vibrato. <br>
<br>
Command E9 is for Retriggering the note quickly. The parameter <br>
specifies the interval between the retrigs. Use a value of less <br>
than the current secondary tempo, or else the note will <br>
not get retrigged. <br>

Command EA/B are for Fine Volume Slide Up/Down . Much the same as <br>
the normal Volume Slides, except that these are easier to control <br>
since they don't depend on the secondary tempo. The parameters <br>
specify the amount to slide by e.g. if you have a sample playing <br>
at a volume of 08 (Hex) then the effect EA1 will slide this volume <br>
to 09 (Hex). A subsequent effect of EB4 would slide this volume <br>
down to 05 (Hex). <br>
<br>
Command EC is the Note Cut . This sets the volume of the currently <br>
playing note to 0 at a specified tick. The parameters should be <br>
lower than the secondary tempo or else the effect won't work. <br>
<br>
Command ED is the Note Delay . This should be used at the same time <br>
as a note is to be played, and the parameters will specify the <br>
number of ticks to delay playing the note. Again, keep the <br>
parameters lower than the secondary tempo, or the note <br>
won't get played! <br>
<br>
Command EE is the Pattern Delay . This delays the pattern for the <br>
amount of time it would take to play a certain number of rows. The <br>
parameters specify how many rows to delay for. <br>
<br>
Command EF is the Funk It command . Quite what it does is a mystery <br>
to most people, including me. Some say it played the sample backwards,<br>
others that it implemented some crude filtering effect, but nobody <br>
seems to know exactly. Very few trackers actually support it. </font><font
