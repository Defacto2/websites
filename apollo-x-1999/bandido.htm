<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Interview with
BanDiDo / DOD &amp; RiSC</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Haven't heard of
either BanDiDo or DOD ? Well, DOD stands<br>
for Drink Or Die. It's one of the longest lasting groups in<br>
the Warez Scene. It's a utils group, one of the best there<br>
is. And BanDiDo, well, he is a respected council in both<br>
DOD and RISC. He has been in the Scene since the oldskool<br>
days. And he knows what it's all about. Here you will<br>
see a bit about how he thinks about the old days, and<br>
the present days. Enjoy, and be sure to check out the<br>
great DOD page at : <a href="http://www.drinkordie.com">www.drinkordie.com</a><br>
<br>

Hello BanDiDo, Let's start with your age, full nick, nationality<br>
and which groups you have been in.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
Ok, to start with I was born in 1962....I am English (I live in<br>
Australia). I started my *Career* back in the BBS days way<br>
back. Then I founded ViCE couriers in 1995 I think it was, then I<br>
joined DRiNK OR DiE and Razor 1911. I was also in RCN at one point<br>
before it died. I am currently RiSC council and DOD council.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] : <br>
Can you tell us a bit about your work in the groups, for example<br>
in RiSC and DOD as council, what is it you do for them ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
Well, in terms of RiSC... I help with site adds since I am +siteop<br>
on about 20 sites. And I do some PR &amp; logistical work. In terms<br>
of DOD, I basically am part of the few people who actually run <br>
DOD in terms of operations. I concent rate on site duties mostly,<br>
although I recruit &amp; do release work as needed. Basically I do<br>
it all as needed.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
When did you first notice that there was something called<br>
the Scene, and how did you notice it ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
Wow that is a question that makes me think. Well I started<br>
off during the BBS era, I found my way onto the local pirate <br>
boards, and eventually onto mainstream systems. I suppose<br>
all those mysterious nfos made us all wonder what more <br>
there was, some of us stuck around to find out :). I miss<br>
analouge days, the Scene is a sad place to be now in some<br>
ways. It is changing and not for the better.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Do you have any skills, like cracking or coding ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
No, personally I don't code, I can barely write a batch<br>
file that doesn't hate me :) I do however have a rather<br>
nice team capable of coding and cracking anything.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
So how did you actually get into the scene without <br>
having any special skills ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
Ah skills... well I have always led groups, so I suppose<br>
I have a measure of organizational ability. I was always<br>
a trader too. I suppose I have proved over time to many<br>
in the scene I have some ethics and tend to work rather<br>
hard. DOD doesn't tend to have incapable people running<br>
areas of responsability. If you mean skills in terms of<br>
coding and such, no, as I mentioned, I have others that<br>
are capable of all those things. I myself sadly never had<br>
the patience to learn to code, I wish I did though. Coding<br>
is the real *essence* of the PC world, and I admire <br>
anyone who had the patience to develop skills.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Why did you start the group ViCE and how did it go ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
ViCE was the first group I was ever in... I suppose<br>
it arose out of a desire of one or two people to <br>
enter the larger scene. ViCE was great for years,<br>
until the scene started to change.That is a long <br>
story. The current bunch of morons using the name<br>
*VICE* has no sanction to do so,&nbsp; and most of the <br>
scene know it. It was a great group for the years<br>
it existed. It's death almost had to happen, the<br>
courier scene is in danger of becoming extinct.<br>
With the recent busts, and more on the cards,<br>
more and more sites will abandon couriers.<br>
The new groups doesn't verify their people,<br>
any fool can join a group and get on some site,<br>
very dangerous.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
What policy does DOD have about Couriers ? Do you <br>
use your own group, or external courier groups ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
DOD uses internal couriers only. We have several<br>
good ones from RiSC &amp; DEV etc.&nbsp; DOD has a strict<br>
policy, we release only to DOD HQs, we never send<br>
DOD releases to other sites, no matter how *good*<br>
the release is. And we send to ALL DOD sites, even<br>
the slowest and smallest and most obscure gets<br>
DOD pre. We have a great relationship with out site-<br>
ops, and most DOD sites have been with us a long time.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
How about member application, what do you demand<br>
from people who wants to join DOD ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
DOD has one major criteria, we look first to<br>
*friendship*, from that all else springs. Of course<br>
applicants need to provide whatever is needed<br>
as per their reason to apply. But the main thing is<br>
long term friendship. Most DOD has been with us<br>
for years, and I cannot remember anyone when<br>
anyone left DOD. I have personally rejected a <br>
great number of applicants who did not fit our<br>
personality type. We have no need of egomaniacs,<br>
we seek those who wish to be part of the family,<br>
and unlike some other groups, DOD actually is<br>
a close knit family.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Since you didn't have any &quot;real&quot; skills, how did you<br>
end up in DOD, by friendship ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
I have been in DOD for many years now, I started<br>
out as a trader, then site coordinator when I was<br>
promoted to Senior, and finally Council.&nbsp; As I stated<br>
previously I do all things really.<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
[biXen] :<br>
What is in your opinion the biggest difference<br>
between the Scene when you joined it and how it<br>
is today ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
Oh easy... once upon a time the Scene was Elite for real.<br>
You had to know a guy who knew a guy who knew a&nbsp; <br>
guy etc. And of course trading was legit. Nowadays<br>
there are a million newbies, which infect us, most of<br>
which are never checked out. And of course after<br>
PFTP, the whole courier Scene is a complete joke, <br>
and thus is fast becoming redundant. We have lost<br>
a lot of the alure and the little secrecy we had. I fear<br>
the Scene is far too open and few pay enough <br>
heed to the real dangers of what we do.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Have you ever been close to getting busted or<br>
anything like that ? Any incidents with members or<br>
something ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
I cannot be busted, I have no warez here... And it <br>
is not a crime to be in a group. I have however,<br>
known many people who have been busted over<br>
the years. Some due to their own stupidity, but<br>
the majority due to &quot;narcs&quot;. (Another unwelcome<br>
part of the newbie attacks we suffer from)<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
[biXen] :<br>
What is a &quot;narc&quot; ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
A narc... is a wholly loathsome creature, who <br>
for personal reasons, or for pleasure, gains much<br>
pleasure out of informing authorities of the<br>
activities and/or personal information&nbsp; of those<br>
he/she called *friends*. Many sites and a number<br>
of individuals have fallen to such&nbsp; low-life <br>
creatures. Sadly the Net attracts such bottom-<br>
dwellers, people who in real life noone would<br>
talk to, and the anonimity of IRC&nbsp; is a place they<br>
revel in. Some of us though, maintain ethics <br>
and standards still....</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Did or do you have any idols ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
Ahh scene idols ! Well, let me tell you a story...<br>
I remember in my local BBS days, reading things<br>
like DOD nfos... all those site names, and those<br>
mystical nicks... then years later I found myself<br>
invited to the channel #DOD ( I had a supply or<br>
two), and finally saw some of the nicks. Well it<br>
was meeting pop stars, and to this day, old <br>
legends like EViLTEA, Thepep, bob226 and many<br>
others are my real idols. But my true idols are<br>
old friends, like bcre8tiv, PsedO, fo_twenny and<br>
so many others. In short I adolize true friends <br>
on IRC.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
[biXen] :<br>
Do you ever regret your time spent in the Scene ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
Nope, and for years I was online 12 hours a day, 7<br>
days a week. Loved every minute.<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
[biXen] :<br>
Do you ever keep your eyes on other groups, if <br>
so how ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
Oh I have spies all over. I get intelligence on almost<br>
everything that occurs. Everyone knows I tell no <br>
tales, and I have a lot of friends in all groups. So I<br>
am fairly well informed. At a high level, some of us<br>
important intelligence that effects all groups.<br>
<br>
When I say spies I mean tongue in cheek...I care <br>
little for what other groups do, although I get told<br>
most of the things that go on.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Name the things you would do to have the best&nbsp; day<br>
of your life.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
Hrmm... Win a few million dollars in the lottery,<br>
then I could go to Europe or something and buy some <br>
100MB pipies :)&nbsp; Money baby... with money the rest is<br>
just shopping for what you want :)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Any things you want to tell the people that read this ?<br>
Some hints to don't make them act like lamers when<br>
trying to join the Scene or something ? :)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
Getting into the Scene is not so hard nowadays...<br>
Remember the Scene is a wide church...groups&nbsp; like<br>
ZERAW who concentrate on public type site work<br>
do amazing things.&nbsp; As far as Major League, well it <br>
takes time and contacts. You don't build trust in one<br>
day. But anyone stupid enough can easily waste <br>
hundreds of hours a year in the warez Scene, it<br>
just takes some time &amp; efforts to get in :)<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">[biXen] :<br>
Okay, any final words or greets ?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">[BanDiDo] :<br>
Oh I am happy to greet anyone who still holds true<br>
to the core values of the scene, I hope more people<br>
start to realize that we play a dangerous game. We<br>
are not protected by obscurity, we are not invisible,<br>
and when you play with fire, you can indeed get <br>
burnt. I hope folk remember, make damn sure who<br>
you are talking to on IRC, verify anyone close to you.<br>
Be careful , this is not a game we play...and prison<br>
is not a nice thing guys...</font></p>
