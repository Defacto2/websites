<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">apollo-X is
finally online, it's&nbsp; been 7<br>
months since the idea&nbsp; sprung to life. <br>
Now the demo&nbsp; scene, can hopefully get <br>
even more people to join their&nbsp;&nbsp; ranks.<br>
It is truly needed...</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Word is that
Future Crew is making a new demo to be<br>
released in 1999.I get this rumour confirmed by Trug<br>
of the Future Crew and Bitboys.He says that they<br>
are truly making a new demo,but it is going slow<br>
since all members are dedicated to other projects<br>
as well, such as games and graphic cards.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">I found out that
Hornet is shutting down its demo<br>
archive.Was I the last to know ? Anyway it's really<br>
sad for the scene because they have collected almost<br>
everything that ment something to the demoscene<br>
before,now,and for the future.</font></p>
