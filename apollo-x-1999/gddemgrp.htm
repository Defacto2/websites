</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Future Crew from Finland is
the best sign of success I know of today.3 of the crew <br>
is now working on the next generation 3D chip &quot;Glaze3d&quot;.It's performance is<br>
currently in 4x Voodoo 2 class.(Check out their firm at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
href="http://www.bitboys.fi" target="_blank">www.bitboys.fi </a>) They are <br>
doing GREAT work 3 or more of them are working in Remedy Entertainment,<br>
which are making in my opinion&nbsp; &quot;the best game of 99&quot;.It looks stunning,and
the <br>
background and gameplay seems to rock.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure to check out&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Future Crew is truly a great chapter in the history of demos.Be sure to check out <br>
<a href="gddemos.htm">&quot;The Best Demos&quot;</a> for the best Future Crew demos. <br>
<br>
Lately people have been criticising Future Crew for beeing to commercialized and so <br>
on,Microsoft greetings and so on.They have also been charactirized as unfriendly. <br>
I definately don't share that view.I have contact with one of their members every <br>
day,and he's a great guy,friendly and helpful.I've also been in touch with some <br>
others,and personally I don't think that the fact that they're making some awesome <br>
stuff that will revolutionize the PC history will change their personalities.It's not <br>
their fault that they are REALLY good. <br>
<br>
In my opinion,Future Crew is the group that has done most,and will do most for both <br>
the Demoscene and the PCs.Just check out the development pages,and imagine a PC with <br>
Glaze 3d,and playing Max Payne.Add a coke and I would be there.YES :) Look at their <br>
demos,I guarantee you won't regret !!! </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3"

#EMF - ElectroMotiveForce#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">EMF from Finland is also a
great group.They are in my opinion not better than the <br>
Future Crew,but they are up there.I think they still are in the scene.They have done <br>
well at demo parties and their demos you should get are these : Verses,Eclipse,Caero <br>
and Porno.They are extremely good.Many EMF members are members of Plant also.They <br>
have been a bit silent lately,they probably have been a bit busy.I hope they will <br>
come back strongly. </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
#Triton#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Triton from Sweden have
showed of mostly with their great tracker : Fasttracker II <br>
I think that is the most used tracker by musicians today.Many probably remembers them <br>
because they were the first ones that could push FC off the nr.1 spot in the charts. <br>
They did that with Crystal Dreams II.They also released Crystal Dream I which was ok. <br>
They are currently into some gaming stuff.</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3"

<br>
#Complex#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Complex (also seen
Komplex,but Complex at ASM so...),a Finnish group,one of <br>
many,but in fact this one is also quite good.They made a demo called Dope which is <br>
very good.They are quickly into the new technologies,they were the first to make <br>
good 3dfx and Java demos.I never thought it could be possible to make a demo with <br>
java,but they proved it.Another great finnish group. </font><font face="Haettenschweiler"
size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
#Valhalla#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Valhalla,from England.They
have huge success.Solstice was the one i personally <br>
found best,but they've also released Visions Of Light,and a OS/2 promo. <br>
One of the few English groups,but also a good one.One of their coders,Sandman, <br>
has done a coding tutorial in PcFormat,using Djgpp compiler,which is quite good. </font><font
face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
#Hornet#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Hornet from USA.One of the
most important groups nowadays.But in way not anymore. <br>
It's AMAZING demo archive,filled with over 400 gigz of history,is shutting down <br>
soon.They have done much for the demoscene,not done many productions,but they<br>
have done the scene very international.They are also kinda my inspiration... </font><font
face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
#Orange#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Orange from Finland.A shy
group it seems like.Hard to find any info about them. <br>
Mostly known for their weird stuff.Many cool effects,and much robot talk in their <br>
demos.They are extremely creative and good.All in all a group you should check <br>
out too see all sides of the subjects,kind of... </font><font face="Haettenschweiler"
size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
#Psychic Link#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Psychic Link from
England.One of the most anticipated groups lately.They have an <br>
amazing talent in Statix.Their best production in my eyes is Juice,followed by <br>
Paper.Juice is my favourite demo,Second Reality following close after it. <br>
Juice is a superb blend of music and graphix,that roxx the world,really much. <br>
Everyone should see this.This group could have been the new Future Crew with <br>
some serious work and dedication,but it seems like its already dissolved. <br>
Only Statix is in the scene,and him too only partly. </font><font face="Haettenschweiler"
size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
#COMA#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">COMA from Finland.Another
quite different group.Also this group has different <br>
in a positive way.You have to check out Stikman too understand properly.It's a <br>
stickman dancing to some cool tunes.It's really awesome,and so low-tech. <br>
They also have a cool demo called Insects.They have called themselves KOMA <br>
also,probably just for fun. </font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
#TBL - The Black Lotus#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">The Black Lotus from
Holland.A great new group,which I mean is the best <br>
ambassador of win95/98 demos.Stash is just magic.A beautiful blend of <br>
music and graphics,awesome.You have to get Stash,and also Jizz,and if <br>
you get hooked,get Astral Blur also :) They have a win32 programming <br>
resource up.When I get the address im going to put it here... </font><font
face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
#Pulse#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Pulse from Poland &amp;
France.Have an oldskoolish style on their work which is <br>
really cool.That doesn't mean that their programming is old fashioned,no,they <br>
are ahead of their time almost.Check out these greaters: Square,Reve,Broken Pipe <br>
or just grab the rest also,it's cool anyway :) </font><font face="Haettenschweiler"
size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
#Scoop#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Scoop from Norway.Really
cool group which I think is a root of Funcom which is <br>
a game company or something.They have made some original and cool demos.You got <br>
to check out Ninja 2.It's really cool.Goes almost like a cartoon,and it features <br>
ninjas,what more do you need ??? Go get it !!! </font><font face="Haettenschweiler"
size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
#Nooon#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Nooon from France.Weird
group with some cool releases.Worth to check out if <br>
nothing else.Get &quot;No&quot;,a small intro.Fancy... </font><font
face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
<br>
#Wild Light#</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><font face="Haettenschweiler" size="3" color="#FFAA0B">Wild Light is from
Finland.They got a really cool 64k intro,DRIFT, that caught <br>
my notice,really cool music,and some really cool flame effects.This group is <br>
also dissolved I think,stop me if I'm wrong :)</font></p>
