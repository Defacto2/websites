&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well i wanted to talk about Relativity (yes
the emag, duh) , i run it with the help of my best&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
friend on the net En|{rypt, we started the magazine aprox 1.5 years ago
.. we grew big thanks to my
<BR>coding abilities and enk's organizing abilities and the amazing members,
which helped producing
<BR>unbelievable art, articles and irc managing, Would you like to know

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some time ago i got this
idea "how to make the <FONT COLOR="#FF9900">emag scene</FONT> a better
place", i decided to share
<BR>the engine with all the emag groups out there that wants a good engine
for dos mode with all the right
<BR>features, i made it so the engine is an exe and a support file, the
support file will never change,
<BR>it has all the font,music, and essential files, the exe is the engine
and by using the support file and
<BR>another file which is the <FONT COLOR="#FF9900">Emag</FONT> file itself
and every magazine releases one file, this solves many
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF9900">compatibility</FONT> problems and less sizeable
downloads (that is if a lot of groups <FONT COLOR="#FF6600">coop up together</FONT>,
and
<BR>make emags under one universal engine), from that a new concept appeared
in my head, <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">#emags</FONT>
<BR>a channel for all emags to d\l and get informed on news and such ...
if you are a new emag and you
<BR>want to join, please email me .

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever heard about racism ??,
well racism exists in the net, on irc, on the warez scene and more
<BR>people tell racist jokes and say "it was just a joke..get over it",
well my response is "even a racist joke, is offending no matter the intent,
we are all the same on the net, nicknames, ip addresses, so how can we
say&nbsp; we are better than this person ..or that person ?, a new section
was added to
<BR>relativity, where it shows the stupidity of racism, the wrong of it
and the lies of it, and to show
<BR>the scene that we are all the same and we need to be united inorder
to keep our lil planet alive .

<BR>its a nibbles game (i think), i just call it works scriptable.. bcz
you make your own levels and play them, you can add levels and make whatever
you want, take it and read the doc <A HREF="Wrmscr01.zip" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='My First Ever Game (TextMode), A Nibbles LookaLike';return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true;">Worms

<BR>Right now i am working on a few projects, A Quest Game, A Save Game
Analyzer, And a Universal Engine for Magazines, I Also did A game i called
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Fury of the Furry Fighter</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">,
which was derived from the old game </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">fury of
the furries</FONT>, so that's why i call it Fury of&nbsp; The Furry Fighter,
actually all of the sprites are taken from there because its a cute game
and i love it, aswell as the music :) ,if&nbsp; you want to see the <A HREF="Fury.zip" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='FURY FIGHTER (Vga) Final Version !';return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true;">Final
Version!</A> , Press &lt;= There .

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also made a program that translates
from Pascal into Hebrew pseudo code, if u know hebrew and you are a coder
from israel and u have too much homework to write in ivrit mivnit.. then
u can use this util its 90% done and working .. and it should do just about
all of you home work, it did for me :)&nbsp; <A HREF="Pas2ivr.zip" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='For Hebrew Speakers Computer Students ONLY !!';return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true;">[Pascal
2 Ivrit Mivnit]</A> !!! get it now if you don't want homework again ..

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Save Game Analyzer (Sga for short),
which i am working on for <A HREF="http://www.ping.be/aforest/cm.htm" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='A Forest Software HomePage';return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true;">A
Forest Software</A> who made the program <A HREF="http://www.ping.be/aforest/cm.htm" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='A Forest Software HomePage';return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true;">Cheat
Machine</A> that most of you already know by now, Right now a beta is available
only to Cm's Beta testers and my closest friends :) .
<BR>Mr <A HREF="http://www.ping.be/aforest/cm.htm" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='A Forest Software HomePage';return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true;">Cheat
Machine</A>, Jan Hertsens wanted me to make a snowie logo for <A HREF="http://www.ping.be/aforest/cm.htm" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='A Forest Software HomePage';return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true;">Cheat
Machine</A>,
<BR>and so i did.. you can check it out on the next release of <A HREF="http://www.ping.be/aforest/cm.htm" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='A Forest Software HomePage';return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true;">Cheat
Machine</A> . (maybe someday i'll do even more ??) .

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sprite technology (you can call it
that way :) ) that i used in my game and will use in future games is made
with a program that i did called <A HREF="Mdb-anim.zip" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Sprite Grabbing Program .. For Game Makers .';return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true;">AniMdb</A>
and you can d\l it from the Game projects page aswell, i am also using
a <A HREF="Pal-ed.zip" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='The Easiest Palette Editor';return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true;">Palette
editor</A> that i made, and a <A HREF="Pal-opt.zip" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='A Palette Optimizer';return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true;">Palette
optimizer</A> that i did aswell .
<BR>Atm i am converting my sprite lib to C++ bcz i have to make the quest
project for school...

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About animdb i called it that way bcz,
its animation - Muaddib's Data Base (i give that name to
<BR>all my formats the files are .mda (muaddib's data animation) and you
can load cels gifs &amp; mda files
<BR>palette files and save in so many diff ways, the idea of the sprite
grabbing is that you capture a sprite into a block in the memory and after
you have all the blocks u need you write to the changeable file format
i made :), and with my sprite moving procedure you can move it around in
any language .

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to incorporate the anim file
format in you game you must contact me for now, and
<BR>i will tell you the <FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">format</FONT> of the files
:) and how to use my animation <FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">grabbing sprites proggi&nbsp;</FONT>
........&nbsp;&nbsp; (aka animdb), my sprite engine is a<FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">
freeware</FONT>, so if you want to use it you can ask and i'll provide
it
<BR>to you, also right now i am working on a cpp (object oriented) version,
its not a c version so don't
<BR>get confused .

<P><A NAME="Relativity"></A>Here is some more information about the <FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Essence</FONT>
of relativity :

<P>Relativity Productions is dedicated to everyone in the world. We believe
in freedom of speech (information) and we feel that if the readers do not
like the contents within the emag, they should not get it. Each issue of
Relativity Emag progressed up to the point where we were sending out 3500
copies within 48 hours on IRC alone. If we count all the sites around the
world that carry our emag, there are so many people getting it that we
don't bother counting. Distribution of the emag is made in every way possible
and everyone likes the emag so much that they pursue the task of spreading
it around themselves. There are many individuals involved in dedicating
spare time to contribute to the emag. They are the people that make up
our group. We have people helping us from every corner of the world including
Australia, Canada, Germany, Hawaii, Malaysia, Israel, Sweden, and the United
States. Those are just to name a few. The best part about Relativity is
that we have many connections that bring us the success. Without you the
reader, we wouldn't be here right now. Even for the people who are maybe
a bit illiterate or are afraid of the whole concept of computers, our emag
increases their awareness and knowledge. To be successful, knowledge and
research builds the foundation. From me and my friends at Relativity Productions,
