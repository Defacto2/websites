During the past year, stock investors, both institutions and individuals,
have been captivated by the World Wide Web. What we've done is to sift
through the hype and rapidly changing Net landscape and select three issues
that are relatively unknown and represent minimal downside risk. <A HREF="nest.html" TARGET="content">Show charts</A>

The two principles in the company come from a print-graphics background,
designing and producing annual reports and trade publications. They've evolved into a company that
produces and distributes technical journals pertaining to high-technology issues in a
rather novel fashion-- over the WWW. Their work utilizes the talents of well
known contemporary artists, such as Schnotbel, Gurvitz, and DeSheilds and
incorporates video, film, and textured two and three-dimensional images to
enliven the typically dull printed journals. Today, 10% of the Fortune 500 subscribe to Tech2 publications. Consequently, their net income in
1996 was $1 million on revenues of $6 million, compared to a loss of $650,000
on revenues of $2 million in 1995. And, if you're a shareholder, you get to
sample their work in their own innovative annual report.

Software innovation is the driver that the Web needs to grow and survive.
NanoPrint, a two-year old venture based in San Diego, has a niche-market--
developing a publication which charts and reviews the most realistic and imaginative 3-D graphic software available for the Web. Based on the amount of NanoPrint stock purchased over
the past three months, this is a company to watch. They have little
competition and are working to chronicle the key software players in the Intranet
arena. In Silicon Valley, industry leaders have come to rely on NanoPrint's reviews, especially of
presentation graphics packages. The company showed a growth of 33%
based on a 25% return on stockholder equity in '95, compared to 15% in '94.

The Webb Group's annual extravaganza, "WebFest", is to the WWW what MacWorld is to Mac enthusiasts-- a twice
yearly show devoted to innovation, expertise, seminars, and product
announcements for Net Surfers everywhere. In fact, after two years of
domestic shows, 1997 will mark the debut of "WebFest" in both Europe and
Asia. These shows generate revenue not only from booth rentals, show, and
seminar attendance, but also from the publication, NetImage, The monthly
magazine reaches over 2 million readers already, with projections of another
million by mid-1997. Net income for fiscal-year 1996 was $7 million, with an
operating income of $14.5 million. Projections show a steady growth of 15-18%
for  the Webb Group over the next three years, thanks mainly to the
proliferation of alternatives, known as ISPs, to major vendors such as AOL.
