<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="Obj2bin.zip">An Obj2bin converter .</A>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>this util is a good util if you get a source in pascal or c/c++ that
someone used a binobj.exe on a file lets say a gif and now u have a mixed
up gif.. this util restores the original gif, Brian also found out that
this util takes an asm obj that has no stack and makes it into a .com file
... cool..very!&nbsp;</TD>

<TD><A HREF="Wstwdunp.zip">WestWood .pak files unpaker !</A>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>westwood uses in dune 2 or kyrandia files with a .pak ext so .. i took
a look at the files and i saw i can hack them, so i did a very good util
to extract all of those files that are inside the .pak data files to ur
dos, so now you can play all the neat waves the games has.. and use them
in your own programs .</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><A HREF="File2pas.zip">File2Pas</A>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>This Util takes a raw file ( any file ) , and makes it to an array
in pascal ($i filename) ... really useful in all of those demo making under
the 64k&nbsp;
<BR>i got inspired by the maker of Cheat Engine / Nuke / Asskicker&nbsp;</TD>

<TD><A HREF="Removed From Space Limits ..">Html2txt</A> ( Removed From
Space Limits )&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>actually what this program does is it takes a normal html file and
saves it as a text, pure text&nbsp;
<BR>i made this program bcz my netscape had a bug in saving html files
to text files, this helped me when i took lyrics of some heavy metal band
(really heavy.. death doom ..) and i had the fucking mixed html file and
i couldn't translate it into text.. so i decided after a few months to
make it .. and wallla</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><A HREF="Countln.zip">Line Counter</A>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>i wanted to count the lines in relativity , so first i did it manually..
but after i update the code every time .. i find that its too hard to do
that&nbsp;
<BR>so i made this line counter util.. it counts all the lines in the .pas
(only) files u have in the current dir. ... btw relativity has 26000 lines
..so now you know why i need this util so much .</TD>

<TD><A HREF="Cmp2file.zip">Comparing 2 Files</A>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>in my days of cheating i decided i needed a good compare util , better
than the dos one, so i made this one.. the result file has a neat format
for you cheaters out there to know where the offset the hexa decimal and
char of the wanted byte, now i just use it to compare palettes in my games
..&nbsp;</TD>

<TD><A HREF="Uptolow.zip">Uptolow</A>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>i got a source file that everything in it was in FUCKING BIG LETTERS,
so i decided to make a util to convert all the big letters to small ones..stupid
ass coders.. don't write in big letters everything !!! arrrrrrrrrrrg .</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><A HREF="Pkfuck.zip">Pkfuck...</A>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>this small util was an idea from brian, he has some wacko ideas from
time to time, he wanted to delete the sig file of the pklited file and
replace the sig itself so no one will know its a pklite file..&nbsp;
<BR>ofcourse he came to me.. and i had to make it (from the start), i just
hate other ppl code ..&nbsp;
<BR>it should work .. but who knows .. you try it,&nbsp; and please tell
me if it works .!!</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<BR>if i'll make more neat utils i'll post them here ..
