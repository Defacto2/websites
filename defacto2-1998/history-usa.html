On September 12, 1991, a new crack group was formed - USA.
<p>
From the moment the idea of this group was conceived to the moment when we put out our first release took around twelve hours. In this short time span a lot of phone calls were made while members, dist sites and couriers were inducted, strategies were planned, a management staff was formed, and the USA name was created. USA stands for United Software
Association. It is a totally generic group name, we agree, but when we formed USA in this short time we already had a release in hand and wanted to get it out quickly, so we didn't spend a whole hell of a lot of time thinking about what to call ourselves. Plus we liked the catchy three letter combo of USA so we went with it. The "USA" title just has a way of growing on you, so even if you don't like it now, give it some
time, you will get used to it. I think we spent all of about a half hour on deciding the group name and spent the rest of the twelve hours on more productive things. The name of a group isn't what makes the group anyway, it's what the group releases that counts, as I'm sure you'll all agree.
<p>
As it turned out there was a EURO Amiga group trying to break into the American PC scene about the same time USA was forming. This group is known as Fairlight and it’s founder and president is Strider. We hooked up with Fairlight and we are basically acting as Fairlight's PC Division, but with an identity and management staff that is all our own. Strider will be supplying us with Euro-PC originals once in awhile,
and trying to set up more PC contacts for us in Europe. Strider has already come through with a couple of games for us, 7 Colors and The Immortal, and is working on many more. Fairlight has been around for many years and Strider started it back in the old C-64 days. It is a group that has been going strong on the C-64 and Amiga scene for quite some time now, and should be doing well on the PC scene once things get
set up.
