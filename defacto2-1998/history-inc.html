Hi..
 my handle is Severina.. I used to be known as Sarah Connor, in the good ol' days..<p>
 Here's my INC history/story..<p>
The year(s) may be off, give or take a year or half a year.. I'm 20 now, and I've lost alot of brain
 cells since that time. :) It was about 1990 when the groups were going strong, and I believe people started noticing INC. They were one of the
 first groups around that will carry a place in all of the old school pirates. I joined in 93.. as Sarah Connor, which had been my nickname since
 I started bbs'ing in '87-88..but there's a lot of history pre-93 for INC. It was run by Line Noise - which ran a very respectable bbs down here in
 South Florida, called Star Frontiers. Their main rival was THG at the time. They were the 2 largest (imho) groups around, and were constantly
 battling. There were other groups around at the time, USA/FLT, TDT, SkidRow, and TRSI. If I forget any, please let me know.. I'm looking for
 people from my days to email back and forth with. Then control was handed down from Line Noise to Cool Hand, which ran the group until about the
 time that I joined, or a little after.. probably until about 6 months after I joined. I had gained my respects from the group, and went on to help
 form INC-AD, the INC Art Division. From Cool Hand, control was passed on to Fort Perfect. Cool Hand had some difficulties, and left the group
 (or was he kicked out? I don't remember that far back (i do remember the 0700 conference that it happened in, though).. Ford Perfect ran the Heart
 of Gold BBS. It ran PCBoard and it was pretty much the place you'd go if you were a senior courier. That's where all the new files were at.
 They had a VMB (voice mail box) where couriers would call in to check on new releases. Couriers were urged to check the VMB regularly. Tension
 broke out in the group, and about '94, a lot of people left INC for Fairlight. I was one of them, since INC had pretty much died. We tried reviving
 it a few times, but it was helpless. Nobody wanted to do it. In the past years, I've still tried to revive INC. Unfortunately, it seems like
 it only wants to live in our pasts, as a memory, than as the excellent, thriving group it was in the early 90's.. After that, many people merged,
 and great new groups formed, such as PWA, DoD, and RAZOR1911 (they were around the same time as INC, though).

My greets go out to Aftermath (SysOP of Nevada Testing Grounds (send me VisionX already, k? :))), Ford Perfect, Rambone, Cool Hand, Line Noise
