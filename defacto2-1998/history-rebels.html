Rebels was founded 1984 in the southwest parts of Sweden. The members were programming demos and swapped programs through their international contacts. The slogan, &quot;We make all days party days&quot; came up one evening when the Swedish members had a party together:). Rebels PC started up spring 1992, formed by Omnibuz and M:et, and immediately adopted the slogan. Today, Rebels PC is one of the top five releasing groups in the world with members worldwide, especially after the merge with Pantera, another great releasing group. And as a new years gift to the scene, the great team of Cell Block 4 has also merged with Rebels. We sure are getting bigger and better and now covers a wide area of skills and talents. During the years, Rebels Sweden has established a tradition to meet for partying, copy parties and other fun stuff. The members have travelled around a lot to meet and have created a good relation and atmosphere in the group. Today, Rebels PC is established worldwide! </font>
