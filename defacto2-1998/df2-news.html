Defacto 2 Metamorphosing
<p>
Defacto 2 Art Division has decided to refocus it’s efforts to web requests only. This means we will not be accepting any new requests or non-web applications. This new move will enable us do most group web requests from a simple logo redesign to a complete webpage overhaul. We can do professional html, web graphics and designs. Plus we have people who can implement cgi, javascript, java, music and  Flash. The best thing about this I feel is that our services are free to non profit scene groups.
<p>
Before we accept requests we feel we need more members to help take on the load. We are looking for people who can do quality html, quality web graphics, custom cgi, custom javascripts or custom java. If you want to be in the best scene web design group in the world why not fill out the online application that can be found at our page. Our members previous web work include www.game-over.net, artpacks.acid.org, www.rebels.org and of cause www.defacto2.net.
<p>
About Defacto2: Defacto 2 started off as an electronic magazine for the scene community. After the demise of the magazine the website was transformed into a scene museum that is still maintained today. A day after new years 1998 Defacto 2 was relaunched and the Defacto 2 Art Division was formed.  This division was created and designed to do free requests for individuals and groups in the scene. In the June of 1998 the Art Division refocused it’s effort to non profit web requests. Defacto 2 is run by Ipggi, Antibody and Skateguy.  It was founded by Ipggi and Saint Tok and can be found at www.defacto2.net.
