Siege was founded in 1995 by Hemp Hoodlum [eclipse/risc] and Critical Mass [risc]. The idea for the group came about when Hemp Hoodlum who had recently left the sinking ship Prophecy; and Critical Mass of SCUM fame got together with the idea of forming a self-sufficient group that would a) release the utilities that ALL end-users could enjoy (from the networking head at a fortune 500 company down to Joe Blow the computer hobbiest) b) not get involved in the ever increasing scene politics and cut-throat competition which was killing the comradery we once saw amongst all groups, and c) would simply have some fun without worrying about being #1, staying #1 or out- releasing the competition at any cost. With this non-traditional yet plausible idea in mind, we set out to come up with a meaningful name that would portray the desired attitude and goals set forth by the group founders. Siege made the most sense, as we were essentially putting the scene under siege in an effort to influence individuals into realizing that the answer to these new abundant problems was in resorting back to the &quot;original ways&quot;. We were sure that with Critical Mass' supplying ability, and my ability for coordination and recruiting, we would be able to put together a group that could stand the test of time and draw enough scene attention to create a loyal support base from which the group could stand.
