The Firm was started in 1986 by three people, Maenstro, Software Sergeon and The Knack. Originally it wasn't a cracking group but rather a sysop organization. It was when these three wanted to start a cracking group that they discovered couldn't figure out a good name, so they just took The Firm. Firm isn't really an acronym but if it was it would be Five-O Is Rigor Mortis (as a joke). Unfortunately many people believed at the time that The Firm stood for First In Releasing Most, which is absolutely false. The original Firm from the eighties died because the old blood was getting to tired and the new blood kept jumping ship to INC and THG.
