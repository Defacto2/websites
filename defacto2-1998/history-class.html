If you had to sum up the original Class into one line you would simply say that it was the best of Prestige with the slack cut away.<p>
Prestige in it's hey day was the best games group in the scene. Many of the best people from the other groups dropped their idling affiliation to join Prestige which in turned made it even stronger. But unfortunately Prestige had turned into a massive group which ended up creating a huge number of mistakes. These mistakes combined with Prestige's near monopoly in the games scene made it the most hated group since Reflux. So at the end of 1996 the best of Prestige left to from a new group called Class. In hindsight there is not to much difference between the old Prestige and the new Class.
