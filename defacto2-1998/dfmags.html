        this was DeFacto's first release. There where problems
        with the viewer for this issue but generally it was okay
        for a first release. Included where 3 interviews (one
        with Igor from Motiv8), 2 articles, an ascii version of
        The Game Review #19 and some group NFO's. </font></p>

        is a more interesting read then the second issue. It was
        released on the 28th of April and had it's first cover
        story, &quot;Rebellion Authority BBS Closed&quot;. There
        was an interview with CyberAngel the once leader of
        Tyranny and DeFacto's first colour TGR. Something worth
        noting in this issue is the Software News article which
        states the estimated release date of both Red Alert and
        Diablo. Both games where due for release in April/May of
        1996. </font></p>

        face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Issue 4
        as I remeber it was a more respectable issue then
        previous ones. We had earned vital expirence and this is
        shown in this issue. I remember that we had managed to
        pick up some ex-RCN members which we where quite proud of
        at the time. Little did we know that those same members
        would end up causing so much conflict between both
        magazines. This issue was release on the 6th of May, with
        it's cover story being Corps Merges Into Pirates With
        Attitude. Most notiable reads in this issue are the
        interviews with Orion and T800 (The Dream Team leader). </font></p>

        face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">I have
        always been disappointed with issue 5. It was released on
        the 14th of May but was no where near an interesting read
        as issue 4. The cover story was &quot;Igor and Davan
        Leave Motiv8&quot; but there was only an exclusive
        article written by Igor to cover this story. This issue
        had only one interview and five articles. </font></p>

        face="Arial">Defacto Issue 6.</font></a><font size="3"
        face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">This
        issue was a week late because the editor (myself) lost
        his email account. Being delayed a week caused a small
        uproar at the time, these days it's common practice for
        magazines to be delayed (just look at Affinity 11). This
        issue was released on the 28th of May, and included 7
        articles and 6 interviews. An interview of note is the
        one with Dizzident of The Cradle Traders, these guys
        ended up forming Devotion. </font></p>

        face="Arial">Defacto Issue 7.</font></a><font size="3"
        face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Released
        on the 3rd of June, this issue is one I would rather
        forget. It was the issue that I made my biggest mistake
        ever. I overhyped the next issue (issue 8), talking about
        how it will be in SVGA, and have a full GUI and using
        digital SFX. Unfortunatly the coder went ill and issue 8
        ended up using the same code as this issue. An interview
        of note is the interview with Midnight Grave Digger about
        ATA (I forget what it stood for). </font></p>

        face="Arial">Defacto Issue 8.</font></a><font size="3"
        face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">I my
        opinion this was the best Defacto ever. It was released
        on 17th June and included many original ideas that can
        now be found in most magazines today. Defacto2 was the
        first magazine in a long time to include a breif sum up
        of the scene happenings for the bi-week. We where also
        the first to have a Spot Light and in this issue it was
        with the legandary The Renegade Chemist. Plus Defacto had
        the first Top-10 ever to be found in a scene magazine,
        and this one was actually funny! While you are looking at
        this issue don't forget to check the interview with
        Anti-D, the one time leader of Fate back in it's glory
        days of 1995. </font></p>

        face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">This was
        our final issue and a disappointing issue at that. My
        worse memories about this issue was when I got hold of
        Piston for an exclusive interview about RoR's fake Quake
        release. I had this interview for two weeks but couldn't
        publish it because there was nothing else to include in
        issue 9 with it. RCN eventually got the exclusive story
        and the credit for it too. Also check out the interview
        with QuaziModem the once leader and founder of GODS and
        how he found RCN very immature and unprofessional. That
        interview at the time almost made my day :) </font></p>
