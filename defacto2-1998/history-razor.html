<font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">
On a rainy evening back in October 1985 three young Norwegian guys decided to form a computer group.
 We were not exactly sure about what we needed the group for but we were really inspired by other big groups at the time, such as Flash Cracking Group 1941, Section 8, Electronic Cracking Association 1998, ABC 1999, Jedi 2001, 1103, Djenghis Khan, Hellmates, SCC, Dynamic Duo etc.
<p>
These three founder members are today known as Doctor No, Insane TTM and Sector9. <p>
A good group does of course deserve a good name, and thanks to Hellmates we decided to call ourselves RAZOR 2992. (No, that's not a typo). The number was put there to separate us from eventual future jerks who would come and steal the &quot;Razor&quot;-label. Besides, most of the other groups used a number too - so why shouldn't we? (We actually had a group of nitwits on Commodore C64 who stole our name for a while and added &quot;Express&quot; behind it - ie &quot;Razor Express&quot;. Not many remembers them today though).
<p>
It didn't take us long to realize that 2992 was a dull number. So we came up with 1911 instead. We all agreed on that it sounded much better. Many people has asked us through the years why we chose exactly 1911. The reason is that the scene on Commodore C64 was full of brainless kids who, for some odd reason, enjoyed using 666 (the number of the beast - from the Revelation) on their demos, letters, diskbags and God knows what else. We thought this was rather childish, after all what has occultism got to do in the scene anyway? So we chose 1911 because it translates to $777 (in the hexadecimal numbersystem). 777 happens to be the opposite of 666 and so it was our small &quot;grow-up-and-get-a-clue&quot;-message to the immature kids in the scene. It may also be mentioned that we seem to be immortal and thus GOD-like (777). Later on we used the name &quot;Project $777&quot; in a demo on Amiga to slag off everyone's that we just didn't like in the scene but couldn't find a good excuse to yell at under the Razor-name. This time more people realized what was going on, but most of them thought it was quite funny so we got away with it (we always seem to).
<p>
The solution came to us without us really realizing what was going on. A brilliant PC-cracker (Darwin) just happened to live in our
 neighborhood. What could be more perfect? It made us able to do everything ourselves, without having to rely on a cracker in another part of
 the world as we were used to. We closed down the Amigadivison (with exeption of Sim, Drake, Murdock and Codex who later made the best and most famous demo ever, VOYAGE).
<p>
We restructured the group totally - the group consisted of a more or less anonymous investor, Darwin, Doctor No, Onyx, Zodact (for supplies),
 me, Black Spyrit (SysOp) Red Baron (Sysop EuroHQ) and Langoliar (SysOp WHQ). Together we managed to put out dozens of games on the PC (a few of the first ones was released in cooperation with Skillion(!)) and the response from the PC-scene was immense. Our little tight group quickly grew from a small, compact and efficient one to a MASSIVE releasemachine. We had no idea things were gonna go so fast. With the exception of a month in late 1991 where Razor was dissolved and became a part of INC we've continuously released games, trainers, docs, intros etc. ever since (There has been about 350 games and countless other productions from us since then). The rest is, as you all know by now, history!
