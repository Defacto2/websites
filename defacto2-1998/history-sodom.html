Founded: 11th June 1995<br>
Died: March 1998
<p>
For all of you, who believed in that crazy group.
<p>
After three hard years of work, crazy things and fun you have now witness the death of one of the oldest surviving utility groups.
<p>
Well the good days are over, the old skool is dieing and the new
generations are taking over. Sodom is yet another victim to time.
But everyone who was ever in the group for a long period of time
will surely remember the Sodom experience for the rest of their lives. Sure
there was a lot of fights, but there was also a lot of fun at the same time. 
<p>  
In general most people who where associated with the group enjoyed
it for it's style and good work. We believed our releases would help you and
we tried our best to get the best. Our three years of dedication shows what we
where striving to do.
<p>  
Not only did we strive to bring you the best releases but also we tried to
bring the public the best group. We designed an excellent web site, released
press releases and even founded the first warez public relations
division within our group for the public. 
<p>  
The core of the group would of have to of been the group's channel, #sodom.
Regulars to this channel all felt they belonged to the Sodom family. It may
sound a bit cliché it was true, you can ask anyone who was apart of it. Very
few groups have that, which is unfortunate. 
<p>  
Defacto (predecessor to Defacto 2) was formed with Sodom blood. This
project was started together with Ipggi and the rest of the team, advertising
through emags was fun back then.
<p>  
While Sodom was considered a world wide group, some how the USA
missed out. We where generally more a European group, so it wouldn't surprise
me if  any Americans reading this never heard about us or never saw our releases.
Despite this to us we where still an international group with many members who
spoke different languages and had different politics. But we where all grateful for
the opportunity to discover something new and different.
