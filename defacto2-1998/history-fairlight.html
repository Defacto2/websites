<font color="#008000" size="2" face="Arial">Q: How did you get into the scene and what groups have you been a member of?<br>
<font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">A: I started out very early on the C64 scene as with a solo carieer. My first
 group was CLCC which was the first letters of my name then Cracking Company after it.. :) .. Then I started a group called Saturn Crackers United
 or something similar but it mainly consisted of me alone.. A bit later on I joined WASP (We Against Software Protection) and changed my name
 to Sir Galahad. At this time there was a few groups around in Sweden. Like SCC,TRIAD and WCC. Some of the WASP members later on joined up with
 WCC (along with some non-WASP members). After some years of glory with WCC, WCC split up into Relax and FairLight. FairLight was founded by me and
 Strider (who used to be No.1 of WCC). Our first &quot;outside&quot; member was Gollum (who used to be solo as LFK if I'm not misstaken). And I've
 been in FairLight since then.<p> We were very famous, and everything went well for a year or two. But I noticed that I liked to be in
 charge, and wanted to make some changes. During an internal group meeting in Easter 1987 me and Black Shadow decided to leave WCC and make our
 own group. On the train back home we were looking for a name for our new group, and suddenly it came to us; 
<p><font color="0000ff">FAIRLIGHT<font color="000000"><p>
It was so simple... So ingenious! FairLight was also the name of a cult game on the C-64 (initially ported from the Spectrum), and also the name of
 the world's most powerful synthesizer company. Jean-Michel Jarre uses those for instance.<p>
 So the name was decided upon, and our initial theme-song became the intro-tune from the game with the same name; FairLight...<p>
